            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Learned and uÅ¿efull View of both the Lawes, once more adventureth it Å¿elfe upon the Opinion of Men, and it may now hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a more indifferent cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure then before, as being committed to a Å¿eaÅ¿on more mature, and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly diÅ¿pos'd; for howÅ¿oever the Time that firÅ¿t brought this forth, could not be charged with any notable diÅ¿temper; yet the Common-wealth wee live in is of that thriving nature, that however the preÅ¿ent time may Å¿till bee good, yet it alwayes makes the Å¿ucceeding Age better then it Å¿elfe. This argues the State not neare her ruine, though Å¿ome unruly Spirits, led by an irregular Motion, have beene bold to anticipate; as if every one that bad Å¿o much pitty as to feare, had alÅ¿o judgement
<pb facs="tcp:16473:3"/>
enough to foreÅ¿ee the ruine of a Kingdome. 'Twas more then enough for Å¿uch Men to Å¿et downe the Fate of a Å¿ingle-Å¿oule, without reÅ¿olving upon the doome of a whole Nation. But theÅ¿e that would Å¿eeme to know Å¿uch high things, are moÅ¿t properly puniÅ¿hed by being neglected: for to a Man that would bee thought to know, and knoweth not, no greater miÅ¿erie can happen, then that hee Å¿hould faile of his Expectation. If I were to Å¿erve or follow any time, I would propoÅ¿e the PreÅ¿ent, which as it hath leÅ¿Å¿e of the pretences of former Ages, Å¿o it hath much more of the Moderation: and if it needs muÅ¿t be Å¿uÅ¿pected that the State is not farre from her fall, let this be the onely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, becauÅ¿e Å¿he draweth Å¿o neere to her perfection. That which heretofore moÅ¿t of all incumbred theÅ¿e Dominions, was the diÅ¿proportion of the Civill Power to the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall. This a Great Prince abated, and the Act was truly maÅ¿culine, yet like thoÅ¿e of the Å¿trongeÅ¿t importance, would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the Å¿ame hand; therefore it was by him Å¿o fully done, on the one Å¿ide, that it might be feared leÅ¿t it Å¿hould runne over on the other. To prevent this, the diÅ¿cretion of theÅ¿e late diÅ¿cerning times hath warily provided; the wiÅ¿edome of the Prince
<pb facs="tcp:16473:3"/>
having Å¿o well tempered both the Powers, that it may now be hoped, they Å¿hall agree one with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as both doe in him, by a glorious correÅ¿pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The State thus bending towards the beÅ¿t, and thÃ© moÅ¿t perfect mediocrity, this Author whoÅ¿e hope that alwayes was, couldnot but revive again; therefore it is, that though hee be dead, hee yet Å¿peaketh. If Å¿till there be that will reprehend theÅ¿e our paines, as if they were caÅ¿t upon a man too much Å¿ought after, be it Å¿o; but theÅ¿e men have leaÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to complaine, for if the matter of this Booke be, as they Å¿uppoÅ¿e, then the onely way to Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿e it will be to make it common, for things of that nature are leaÅ¿t of all enquired for, when they are moÅ¿t eaÅ¿ily to be found; but if they rarely appeare, they are more eagerly Å¿ought after, and the more obÅ¿tinately eÅ¿teem'd.</p>
            <p>VVhen first I would Å¿ee this TreatiÅ¿e, I beheld it at a distance, and not without Å¿ome prejudice; for Å¿o I was prompted by the inÅ¿inuations of a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Report; but finding it under the Protection of the High and Mighty Prince <hi>Iames,</hi> I tooke libertie to reÅ¿olve against all popular contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And now, to Å¿eeke any other Patron for this new Edition, I have thought it altogether inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
<pb facs="tcp:16473:4"/>
               <hi>For what can the man doe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth after the King?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For a Note or two, which I have here and there timerouÅ¿ly let fall, If the Reader expect that I Å¿hould aske his pardon; there may bee cauÅ¿e, but there is no convenience: for this kinde of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is now adayes indifferently Å¿et before thoÅ¿e things that are well, and thoÅ¿e that are ill done. BeÅ¿ides, it would argue Certaine follie, to be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged there for pardon, where our choyce is to offend. VVhat I have here done amiÅ¿Å¿e, I Å¿hall hereafter hope to rectifie, either by doing Å¿omething that Å¿hall be better (if that may be) or (which is the Å¿afeÅ¿t way) by doing Å¿o no more.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST gratious Soveraigne, Å¿ince it hath pleaÅ¿ed Your MajeÅ¿tie of Your Princely care towards the Church, and Your Common-wealth, to take knowledge of Å¿ome differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are in Iudicature betweene Your Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall and Civile Law, and the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law of this Land (by which joyntly Your MajeÅ¿ties State is managed next after Your owne moÅ¿t rare providence, and the wiÅ¿dome of Å¿uch, whom it hath pleaÅ¿ed Your HighneÅ¿Å¿e to aÅ¿Å¿ociate unto Your Å¿elfe in the great affaires of Your Kingdome) I have been bold to offer unto Your MajeÅ¿tie this Å¿imple TreatiÅ¿e, as that which doth lay out the cauÅ¿e of thoÅ¿e Differences, more particularly than
<pb facs="tcp:16473:5"/>
any man hitherto hath expreÅ¿Å¿ed the Å¿ame. In comming to which (becauÅ¿e I doe Å¿peake for thoÅ¿e parts of Your MajeÅ¿ties Lawes, which are leÅ¿Å¿e knowne unto Your people, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teemed no otherwiÅ¿e of them, than they Å¿ee the practice thereof to bee here within Your Land) I have thought good, as it were in a Briefe, to Å¿et out the whole Å¿umme of both the Lawes, to the view of the people, that they may Å¿ee, there is more worth in thoÅ¿e for whom I Å¿peake, than was by many conceived to bee: So that the profeÅ¿sion of the EccleÅ¿ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticall and Civile Law may appeare to the world, neither to bee idle nor unfit for the State; Å¿o farre as it hath pleaÅ¿ed the Royall PredeceÅ¿Å¿ours of Your HighneÅ¿Å¿e to give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment unto it, and Your MajeÅ¿tie Your Å¿elfe to admit of it. In all which there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing Å¿ought, than that Å¿uch greevances as have beene of late offered by one IuriÅ¿diction unto the other, and in conÅ¿equence, to all Your Subjects, who follow any Å¿uits in the Civile or EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Courts, may by Your Princely wiÅ¿dome be conÅ¿idered, and by Your authoritie be redreÅ¿Å¿ed, if they be found to be

greevances indeed: for now as things are, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther IuriÅ¿diction knowes their owne bounds, but one Å¿natcheth from the other, in maner, as in a batable ground lying betweene two Kingdomes; but Å¿o, that the weaker ever go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the worÅ¿e, and that which is mightier prevailes againÅ¿t the other: the profeÅ¿Å¿ors thereof being rather willing to give Lawes and interpretations to other, than to take or admit of any againÅ¿t themÅ¿elves. For which, the weaker appeales unto your HighneÅ¿Å¿e, humbly deÅ¿iring Your MajeÅ¿ties upright and Å¿incere Iudgement to diÅ¿cerne where the wrong is, and to redreÅ¿Å¿e it accordingly, which is a worke worthy Your MajeÅ¿ties high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ideration.

But before I Å¿peake of the Civile Law in particular, I will define what Right, or <note place="margin">What Law is.</note> Law is, in generall: Law therefore is (as <hi>

This Law is primarily divided into the Law publick, and the Law private. The <note place="margin">1. Jus publicum.</note> publick, is that which appertaineth to the generall Å¿tate of the common-wealth, for I meane the Law publick, not in reÅ¿pect of the Forme, that they were publickly made, as we make lawes in our Parliaments (for Å¿o all the Civile Law is publick, as made by publick authority) but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect of the object, or end thereof, for that they concerne the Church, the Clergie, the MagiÅ¿trate, and other like publick functions, none of which levell at the rule of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or equality between man and man, as private lawes doe, but ayme at that which is moÅ¿t fit, ingenerall, for the common State. <note place="margin">2. Jus privatum.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The private Law, or the private mens Law, is that which concernes every Å¿ingular mans Å¿tate; which, for that it is occupied in giving every man his owne, it muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿itie be proportionable to the rule of Equitie and JuÅ¿tice.</p>
                     <p>Private Law is of three Å¿orts, the law of Nature, the law of Nations, and the law Civile.</p>
                     <p>The law of Nature, is that which Nature hath taught every living creature, as the care and defence of every <note place="margin">The Law of Nature.</note> creatures life, deÅ¿ire of libertie, the conjunction of male and female for procreation Å¿ake.</p>
                     <p>The law of Nations, is that which common reaÅ¿on hath eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed among men, and is obÅ¿erved alike in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">The Law of Nations.</note> as diÅ¿tinctions of mens rights, buildings of houÅ¿es,

erecting of Cities, Å¿ocietie of life, judgements of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ies, war, peace, captivity, contracts, obligations, Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion, and the like.</p>
                     <p>The law Civile, being largely taken, is the law that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular Nation frameth to it Å¿elfe, as the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3.

                     <p>And certainly, albeit Å¿undry other Nations by the light of Nature, have many Rules and Maximes in the Civile law: yet, if all the conÅ¿titutions, cuÅ¿tomes, and lawes, of all other people and countries were put together (I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept none, Å¿ave the lawes of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from God) they are not comparable to the law of the <hi>Romans,</hi> neither in wiÅ¿dome nor equitie, neither in gravitie nor in Å¿ufficiency. Whereupon it is, that moÅ¿t of other Nations, (Å¿aving our owne) although they receive not the Civile law wholely for their law, yet they Å¿o much admire the equitie thereof, that they interpret their owne lawes thereby. <hi>Peckius de regul. juris.

If any pilfery or theft be done in a Ship, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, or Inne, the MaÅ¿ter of the Ship, Taverne, or Inne, is to anÅ¿wer double the value thereof, if the Å¿ame be done by himÅ¿elfe, or their Å¿elves, or any of their marriners or Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: for it behoveth them to have honeÅ¿t men, whom they are to imploy in Å¿uch Å¿ervices: But if it be done by any of the paÅ¿Å¿engers, or gueÅ¿ts of the houÅ¿e, the owners of the Ship, Taverne, or Iune, are not to anÅ¿wer for the Å¿ame, for they cannot turne away Å¿uch gueÅ¿ts as come into their houÅ¿e; neither, in all likelihood, know they the quality or condition of their gueÅ¿ts. If any man privily, unwitting

the owner thereof, cut downe, hack, or barke any tree of any Å¿ort whatÅ¿oever, or thoÅ¿e that are of the nature of trees, as Ivie, Reedes, Willows, Å¿o that they be Å¿poyled, hee is to anÅ¿wer the double value of that hee hath cut downe and Å¿poyled: and further, if it be a Vine-tree, to be puniÅ¿hed as a robber. Hee that taketh any thing away from another by violence, is to be puniÅ¿hed in the worth foure fold, for that it is a Å¿in more grievous than theft: If any man upon any ill intent, make a Tumult, whereby any hurt commeth to any man, he Å¿hall anÅ¿er double of that the party is harmed in: If any, upon a burning of a houÅ¿e, or the fall thereof, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Å¿hipwrack, or the Å¿poyling of a boat or Å¿hip, Å¿teale any thing away, or being put in truÅ¿t to keepe any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, conceale the Å¿ame, hee Å¿hall pay the foure double of the Å¿ame; but if any man Å¿et the Å¿ame afire himÅ¿elfe, he is either to be caÅ¿t out to wilde beaÅ¿ts, or is to be burnt with the Å¿ame fire he went about to burne an other with. If any have Å¿pitefully, contumeliouÅ¿ly injured an other man, his wife, or children, in deede, word, or writing, they are to forfeit Å¿o much as the partie greeved Å¿hall eÅ¿teeme himÅ¿elfe injured by, or the Judge Å¿hall taxe it at. A famous Libell is where a <note place="margin">Libell what.</note> man hath of malitious purpoÅ¿e writ, compounded, or Å¿et out any thing to the infamie of an other, without a name, or with a name, and the puniÅ¿hment thereof is death, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently was that he loÅ¿t the power or liberty to make a Will; the like puniÅ¿hment followeth him, that having found an infamous Libell, doth not by and by Å¿poyle the Å¿ame, that the knowledge thereof come not abroad, eÅ¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where the matter thereof is capitall or worthy death.</p>
                     <p>Extraordinary crimes, are thoÅ¿e which have no ordinary <note place="margin">Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Crimes.</note> puniÅ¿hment appointed them, but are arbitrarie at the Judges appointment, Å¿uch as are Sollicitors of other folkes wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockes, and Maids chaÅ¿tities, although they miÅ¿Å¿e of their purpoÅ¿e; Å¿uch as of purpoÅ¿e caÅ¿t myre, durt, or any like filth upon another, to the intent to diÅ¿grace him: Å¿uch as, being with childe, of purpoÅ¿e cauÅ¿e themÅ¿elves to miÅ¿carry: Such as keepe brothell and baudy-houÅ¿es, or other unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

company: Juglers, and Å¿uch as carry about Snakes, and other like Serpents and trumpery to put men in feare: Such as hide and Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿e Corne, to cauÅ¿e the price to be dearer: Such as either make, or uÅ¿e falÅ¿e weights wittingly; for all which, becauÅ¿e there is no proper puniÅ¿hment provided in the Law, they are referred to the puniÅ¿hment of the Judge, who is to puniÅ¿h them according to the quality of the fact, age, and underÅ¿tanding of the offender, and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances according as he Å¿hall thinke good; Å¿o, notwithÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he exceed not a convenient meaÅ¿ure therein, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿tretch the Å¿ame to death but upon Å¿ome great and weighty cauÅ¿e, he is to be content with meaner puniÅ¿hment, as temporall baniÅ¿hment, whipping, or Å¿ome moderat pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary mulct. For violating or defacing another mans Å¿epul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, Imfamy was impoÅ¿ed, beÅ¿ides a pecuniary mulct to be divided betweene the Prince and the party grieved, but if any dig up the corÅ¿e of the deceaÅ¿ed, the puniÅ¿hment is death. If any, by feare of his office or authority, wring any money from any man, or exact more fees in any matter than he ought to doe, or cauÅ¿e him to marry, or doe any other thing he would not doe, the forfeiture is foure double the value of that which hath been taken, beÅ¿ide further puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the diÅ¿cretion of the Judge. Such as drive mens cattell out of their ground, or Å¿ever them from the flock or herd, with intent to Å¿teale them, if they doe it with a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon like unto a Robber, are condemned to be throwne to wild beaÅ¿ts, otherwiÅ¿e are more lightly puniÅ¿hed according to the diÅ¿cretion of the Judge. Such as in Judgement take money on both Å¿ides, or taking upon them the defence of one Å¿ide, betray the cauÅ¿e, and take money on the other Å¿ide, are infamous by law, and are puniÅ¿hed at the diÅ¿cretion of the Judge. Such as receive theeves, and other like malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, are puniÅ¿hed in like Å¿ort as the theeves or malefactors themÅ¿elves are; eÅ¿pecially if they have aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted them in their wickedneÅ¿Å¿e: otherwiÅ¿e, if they onely knew it, &amp; received them, they are more mildly to be puniÅ¿hed, eÅ¿pecially if the offenders were their kinÅ¿men: for, their offence is not like

theirs, which entertain thoÅ¿e, which are no kin to them at all; when as it is naturall for every one to regard his owne blood: and fathers are many times more carefull for their children, than for themÅ¿elves; but if that hee that received them knew nothing of the offence, then is he altogether to be excuÅ¿ed. Such as break priÅ¿on, are to be puniÅ¿hed by death, becauÅ¿e it is a certain treaÅ¿on to break the Princes ward, but if they Å¿cape by the negligence of the Keepers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t whom the preÅ¿umption lyeth ever in this caÅ¿e, they are more lightly to be puniÅ¿hed. If any commit Burglarie, breaking up a doore or wall, with intent to doe a Robbery, if they be baÅ¿e companions, they are to be condemned to the Mynes or Gallies; but if they be of better reckoning, they are to be put from the ranke or order wherein they are, or to be baniÅ¿hed for a Å¿eaÅ¿on. Juglers and like ImpoÅ¿tors, which goe about deceiving of the people with falÅ¿e tricks and toyes, hookes and Å¿uch like, which inÅ¿inuate themÅ¿elves into other mens houÅ¿es, with purpoÅ¿e to Å¿teale, are puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the diÅ¿cretion of the Judge.</p>

The next is Adultery, which is violating of an other mans bed, whoÅ¿e puniÅ¿hment anciently was death, both in the man and in the woman, but after it was mitigated in the woman, Å¿hee being firÅ¿t whipt, and then Å¿hut up in a MonaÅ¿terie: but by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, other paines are inflicted.

Private, which is done without Arms, the paine thereof is the loÅ¿Å¿e of halfe the parties goods, and the infamie of his name. Murtherers and PoyÅ¿oners, Witches and Sorcerers, the crime being

Mixt, which required both care of the minde, and labour of the body, and expence of the purÅ¿e, and are impoÅ¿ed as well in conÅ¿ideration of the thing, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, which every Å¿ubject is to undergoe, unleÅ¿Å¿e by the Law, or by the indulgence of the Prince they are excuÅ¿ed; as Å¿ome are excuÅ¿ed by reaÅ¿on of old age, Å¿ome by young age, Å¿ome for their dignity, Å¿ome for their calling, Å¿ome for their Å¿tate of body, Å¿ome for that they Å¿erve in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿arie Å¿ervices of the common-wealth at home, or abroad, as EmbaÅ¿Å¿adours do, Å¿ome for that they are in neceÅ¿Å¿ary pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Å¿ervices for Gods Religion, as cathedrall Churches, and other Churches are; Å¿ome for that they are of good and neceÅ¿Å¿ary places for Seminaries for the common-wealth, for learning and Å¿uch othe imployments, as Colledges, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and Schooles of learning and nurture are. Legates and EmbaÅ¿Å¿adours had immunitie from all publick Å¿ervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, not onely the time of their embaÅ¿Å¿age, but alÅ¿o two years after their returne; They were called Legates, in that they were choÅ¿en as fit men, out of many; their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on was Å¿acred both at home and abroad, Å¿o that no man might lay violent hands on them without breach of the Law of Nations. Such as are MagiÅ¿trates of Cities ought Å¿o to governe, that no negligence may bee juÅ¿tly imputed unto them, otherwiÅ¿e they are to anÅ¿wer it, and that when

their office is expired, they give up a juÅ¿t account, both of what they have received, and what they have layd out, and pay in the reÅ¿idue, if there bee any.

New publick workes, Å¿uch as are good for the Common-weale, every one may make without the leave of the Prince, unleÅ¿Å¿e it be done for aemulation, or cauÅ¿e of diÅ¿cord; but for old works, in which Å¿tands the Å¿ecurity of the Common-wealth, as CaÅ¿tles, Towers, Gates, and Wals of Cities, nothing is to be done or innovated in them, without the Princes war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; neither is it lawfull for any man to grave his name in any publick Worke, unleÅ¿Å¿e it be his, at whoÅ¿e coÅ¿t the worke is done.

and come to the other foure; yet not mentioned there: But yet before I lay open the matter thereof, I will in a word or two Å¿hew why this Volume of the Law is called the Code, who is the author thereof, and out of whom it was collected, what moved the author, after Å¿o many learned titles Å¿et downe before, of Å¿uch things as are in the DigeÅ¿t deduced, by Å¿uch a number of worthy Lawyers (as the Lawes of the DigeÅ¿t themÅ¿elves doe by their inÅ¿criptions Å¿hew; for every law, carrieth with him in his forehead, the name of his Author) to make a new flouriÅ¿h of the Å¿ame, and what the knowledge of the Code doth conferre unto a Student or practiÅ¿er of the Law, more than the knowledge of the DigeÅ¿t doth.</p>

                     <p>The cauÅ¿e that moved <hi>JuÅ¿tinian</hi> hereto, was, that in the <note place="margin">The reaÅ¿on which moved the Emperour to compile the Code.</note> DigeÅ¿t hee found not every caÅ¿e decided, that fals out in common uÅ¿e of life (for how is it poÅ¿Å¿ible, when as every moment there fals out new matter, for which former lawes made no proviÅ¿ion?) and therefore thought good to Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie

that by new Lawes, which he found defective in the old: Å¿o that the multiplication of thoÅ¿e titles grew not, that the Emperour had any meaning, to fill the world with multitude of Lawes, for hee had found the inconvenience thereof already, and therefore had repealed and aboliÅ¿hed Å¿o many thouÅ¿and of old Lawes, as he had; but it came ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that, that the multitude of cauÅ¿es were Å¿o many, that every day there fell out Å¿ome unexpected thing that was never heard of before: beÅ¿ide notwithÅ¿tanding the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneÅ¿Å¿e of the Emperour himÅ¿elfe, and his great Lawyer <hi>Tribonian,</hi> and others, whom he uÅ¿ed for the Å¿electing and chooÅ¿ing out of the pureÅ¿t, beÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t agreeing Lawes among themÅ¿elves, out of that indigeÅ¿ted heap of Lawes he then aboliÅ¿hed; yet they were not Å¿o quick Å¿ighted, but in that great worke, Å¿undry <hi>antinomies</hi> or contrary Lawes paÅ¿t them, which had need to be expounded and amended, and the Authors to be recited. Further, Å¿undry of ancient Lawes were Å¿o Å¿ubtilely written, that there was more wit than profit in them; Å¿o that it was expedient, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Å¿hould explain the Å¿ame, &amp; putting all Å¿ubtility aÅ¿ide, give a right Å¿ence unto the Law.

                     <p>The perpetuall right which is betweene the PurÅ¿er or MaÅ¿ter of the Ship, and the PaÅ¿Å¿engers is, that the PurÅ¿er or MaÅ¿ter be anÅ¿werable for all Å¿uch wares or goods as are brought into the Å¿hip, whether it be delivered to himÅ¿elfe, or any of his Mariners: for he ought not onely to be iuÅ¿t and honeÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, but alÅ¿o uÅ¿e the miniÅ¿terie of honeÅ¿t peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about him; and therefore the MaÅ¿ter of the Å¿hip is no leÅ¿Å¿e bound for their perÅ¿ons than his owne.

                     <p>The perpetuall right that is betweene paÅ¿Å¿engers and paÅ¿Å¿engers, and Å¿aylers and paÅ¿Å¿engers is, that in caÅ¿e of ejectments, and caÅ¿ting out of goods, and other merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diÅ¿e into the Sea in time of tempeÅ¿ts, or other dangers, by rocks or quick Å¿ands, for the lightning of the Å¿hip, becauÅ¿e it is for the common good of all that are in the Å¿hip, and the preÅ¿ervation of the reÅ¿t of the fraught of the Å¿hip, it be made up with the common contribution of all: for good reaÅ¿on it is, that they whoÅ¿e goods are Å¿aved hereby, Å¿hould againe with their goods redeeme the others loÅ¿Å¿e, according to Å¿uch proportion of goods, as they have in the Å¿hip, and the Law of the Sea allowes.</p>
                     <p>But in caÅ¿es of Ejectments, the Law of the Sea is this, (which was taken from the people of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> who in old time were great Å¿eafaring men, and diÅ¿coverers of Å¿undry countries, whoÅ¿e Rules even to this day are holden for good among all Marriners, for the great equitie and indifferencie that is in them) that as well the MaÅ¿ter or PurÅ¿er of the Å¿hip himÅ¿elfe Å¿hall contribute for the preÅ¿ervation of his Å¿hip, as alÅ¿o the paÅ¿Å¿engers for Å¿uch ware as they have in the Å¿hip, of what Å¿ort Å¿oever it be, albeit happely it be but of Å¿mall weight, as pearles, pretious Å¿tones, and Å¿uch like; and if perchance there be Å¿ome paÅ¿Å¿engers in the Å¿hip, who have no ware nor merchandiÅ¿e in it, yet becauÅ¿e themÅ¿elves are a burthen to the Å¿hip, eÅ¿timate is to be made of his or their apparell, rings, and jewels, according to which, he or they are to contribute towards the loÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿uch things as are caÅ¿t out into the Å¿ea: neither is there any thing in the whole Å¿hip excepted, Å¿ave only thoÅ¿e things which are put therein to be Å¿pent, for the common good of all, as victuals, fuell,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16473:52"/>
and Å¿uch like; for thoÅ¿e things are not brought in for any one private mans uÅ¿e, but for the benefit and Å¿ervice of all: and Å¿o much the rather, for that if victuals faile, or other like neceÅ¿Å¿aries want, every one muÅ¿t contribute thereto, or impart of that which he hath for his owne private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ion; but of mens owne bodies, unleÅ¿Å¿e they be Å¿ervants, there is no rate to be Å¿et, becauÅ¿e a free-mans body cannot be eÅ¿teemed.</p>
                     <p>In priÅ¿ing, eÅ¿timate is to be made as well of thoÅ¿e things which are loÅ¿t, as thoÅ¿e things which are Å¿aved, and the price is to be Å¿et downe, not for how much they were bought, but for how much they might be Å¿old, and that for the preÅ¿ent, leÅ¿t the contributors Å¿hould be overmuch char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Neither is it to the purpoÅ¿e that the goods which were loÅ¿t, might have beene Å¿old for more, for that herein regard is not to be had of the gaine, but of the loÅ¿Å¿e. And if any thing that was throwne out were knowne to be decayed or made worÅ¿e by waÅ¿hing with Å¿alt-water, it is not to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teemed as a new freÅ¿h thing, but the price thereof is to be abated accordingly.</p>
                     <p>Now the contribution is to be made in this manner, firÅ¿t the loÅ¿Å¿e is to be Å¿et downe, then the rate of thoÅ¿e things which are Å¿aved, out of which muÅ¿t be drawne an equall portion, porportionable to the quantity of every mans goods he hath in the Å¿hip, to make up the loÅ¿Å¿e, deducting out of the loÅ¿ers goods for himÅ¿elfe, Å¿o much as is anÅ¿we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to his proportion, Å¿o that he Å¿hall neither be made a cleere Å¿aver, nor a cleere loÅ¿er, but in a certaine quantitie rateable to his part.</p>
                     <p>But this contribution is in that caÅ¿e to be made, if the Å¿hip be Å¿aved; for otherwiÅ¿e if a wrack happen, either before the ejectment, or in the ejectment, then whatÅ¿oever any of the vectors or paÅ¿Å¿engers catch, is his owne; neither is there any regard to be had of the loÅ¿Å¿e of the Å¿hip, or of the goods, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e perhaps afterwards they be drawne out of the Å¿ea.</p>
                     <p>But here we are to note, that neither the things that are thus ejected, ceaÅ¿e to be the firÅ¿t owners, neither become his
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16473:53"/>
that takes them up; for becauÅ¿e the firÅ¿t owner doth not count them for goods caÅ¿t away, but Å¿till hee beares that minde to them, that if he may recover them, he will hold them as his owne goods, and in conÅ¿ideration of Å¿o much as afterward hee Å¿hall recover, the contribution in the reÅ¿t Å¿hall ceaÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>Neither if the MaÅ¿ter of the Å¿hip himÅ¿elfe by violence of the tempeÅ¿t, Å¿hall loÅ¿e a MaÅ¿te or a Saile, Å¿hall hee be more allowed therfore, than a Carpenter to whom a houÅ¿e is let out to be built, Å¿hall be allowed for his axe or Å¿awe, if hee breake it.</p>
                     <p>BeÅ¿ide in matters of wrack, there is, as it were, a contract betweene them which have loÅ¿t their goods by Å¿hipwracke, and them upon whoÅ¿e Lands the Å¿aid goods are-driven, that the Å¿ame be reÅ¿tored to them or their heires, if they come in due time to claime the Å¿ame: and therefore it is preciÅ¿ely forbid by the Law, that no man Å¿hall meddle with Å¿uch <note place="margin">L. ne quid. ff. de incendio, ruina, &amp; naufragio.</note> goods as are wrecked, and Å¿uch as are proved to have Å¿tolne any thing thereout are holden for robbers; for that Å¿uch goods being caÅ¿t on land, &amp; recovered out of the Å¿ea, remain Å¿till his who was the owner thereof, and deÅ¿cend upon his heire, neither excheat unto the King, neither to any other whom the King hath priviledged in this behalfe.

Now it followeth, that I Å¿peake Å¿omewhat of thoÅ¿e things wherein the Civile Law dealeth incidently, and by authoritie of the Prince, &amp; is not the ordinarie object of the Civile law, howÅ¿oever otherwiÅ¿e they cannot be handÅ¿omly dealt in, but by Å¿uch as have the skill of the Civile Law.</p>
                     <p>Whereof there be three Å¿orts, the firÅ¿t is matters of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein treatie betweene one Prince and another; the Å¿econd is the ordering of martiall cauÅ¿es, whether they be Civile or Criminall in an Army; the laÅ¿t is the Judgements of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ignes and Armes, and the deciÅ¿ions for challenges of rights of Honour and precedencie, where any of them is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverÅ¿ie.</p>
                     <p>For the firÅ¿t, whereas all other Nations in compaÅ¿Å¿e round about us be governed by the Civile Law, and treaties are to be decided by Law (both for thoÅ¿e things which are in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tion, and to be concluded by Law, and for thoÅ¿e things which are determined by conÅ¿ultation and agreed upon) who is thereto to be choÅ¿en rather than a Civilian, to whom their law is knowne, as well as to themÅ¿elves: and if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he underÅ¿tand not their language; yet hee underÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that language wherein the lawes themÅ¿elves are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and is the fitteÅ¿t tongue for treatiÅ¿es betweene Princes and Princes, becauÅ¿e it is a common tongue to the learned of all the WeÅ¿t part of the world, and thereby every Prince Å¿hall reteine his owne MajeÅ¿tie in parlying, as it were, in his owne language, and not be forced to Å¿peake in an other Princes tongue, which, no doubt, is a great diÅ¿advantage to him that Å¿hall treat; for that every Nation hath Å¿ome proper <hi>Idiom,</hi> not Å¿o well diÅ¿cerned by the booke-Å¿peaker, as perceived by the Natives of the countrey, where it is Å¿poken, and wherein a Å¿tranger may eaÅ¿ily be deceived.</p>
                     <p>How much forreine Princes doe eÅ¿teeme of the skill of a Civilian in theÅ¿e matters, it may be underÅ¿tood thereby, that they never, for the moÅ¿t part Å¿end any EmbaÅ¿Å¿age for the treatie of any league or matter of commerce, but that one or moe of them are Civilians. And if the care of theÅ¿e things be Å¿o great with them, Å¿urely the eÅ¿timation of the

But for colours, his rule is, that the nobleÅ¿t co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour be put in the firÅ¿t part of the field, howÅ¿oever the coate be divided, quarter or pale. And of colours, the golden co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is the chiefeÅ¿t, as that which doth figure the Sunne, which is the fountaine of light, which is moÅ¿t acceptable to every mans eye. The next is Purple or Red, which doth figure the fire, that is the higheÅ¿t and nobleÅ¿t of the foure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, and next the Å¿unne it Å¿elfe in dignitie.

For FirÅ¿t, unleÅ¿Å¿e there be cauÅ¿e why, that which is not, Å¿hould be fained to be, and that which is, Å¿hould bee accounted not to be, and that which is done in one Å¿ort, or at one time, or in one place, Å¿hould be imagined to be done in an other Å¿ort, at an other time, and in an other place, there is no reaÅ¿on a fiction Å¿hould be admitted: for the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth no man to come to extraordinary remedies, but where ordinarie remedies faile: and therefore if that which is in controverÅ¿ie may bee obtained by any other meanes, than by a fiction, a fiction is not to be afforded: but if ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meanes cannot be had, then fictions may be entertained <note place="margin">L. in cauÅ¿a. ff. de minorib.</note> to Å¿upply the defect of the ordinary meanes, that thereby, although the truth be otherwiÅ¿e, yet the effect of the Law may be all one.</p>

Å¿hewed, that the Law approveth fictions, but where there is equitie for it, and the Law it Å¿elfe otherwiÅ¿e cannot have <note place="margin">L Gallus Â§ fi e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus ff. de liberis &amp; poÅ¿thumis. l.

And as the Law cannot proceed to a fiction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out equity, Å¿o neither can it faine any thing that is impoÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for Art evermore followeth Nature; and therefore if a man would faine diÅ¿proportionable things, Å¿uch as the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did in <hi>Horace,</hi> who made Boares wallow in the waves of the Sea, and Dolphins wander in the woods; theÅ¿e fictions in no Å¿ence can be admitted, for that they are Å¿uch, as neither Nature nor ReaÅ¿on can brooke. In like Å¿ort, if a man would faine one to live, who were dead two hundred yeares Å¿ince, <note place="margin">Bartol l fi is qui pro empto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re num. 21. 22. 23. &amp; Å¿equen tib.</note> Å¿o that it were not poÅ¿Å¿ible that hee or any of his equals Å¿hould live at that age, this would not hold in Law, for that it is above the age that the Law doth preÅ¿ume any man may live by Nature; although the Law doth preÅ¿ume Å¿uch as dye in warre for defence of their countrey (for the better encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of thoÅ¿e that are alive, to venture themÅ¿elves in like Å¿ervice for the common-wealth) to live for ever; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e their fame doth flouriÅ¿h for ever: and upon like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on the Law will not Å¿uffer any perÅ¿on to adopt an other for his childe, who is either elder or equall in age unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe, or is not Å¿o farre under his yeares, as by courÅ¿e of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hee might be his naturall childe indeed: Å¿o much the Law deteÅ¿teth impoÅ¿Å¿ibilities, that it will not Å¿uffer a man to faine that which in common Sence and Nature might not be true indeed.</p>
                     <p>Now, if theÅ¿e things be true, as in all reaÅ¿on and Å¿hew, by former precedents they appeare to be true, I would gladly Å¿ee how actions of Trover, (whereby the Common Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers tranÅ¿late unto themÅ¿elves matters of Marine triall) if they be Å¿quared to theÅ¿e Rules of Fictions, can bee maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: for firÅ¿t to Å¿peake of equitie, which the Law requires in theÅ¿e manner of proceedings, what equitie can it be to take away the triall of Å¿uch buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e as belongeth to one Court, and to pull it to an other Court; Å¿pecially, when as the Court from whence it is drawne, is more fit for it, both in reÅ¿pect of the fulneÅ¿Å¿e of knowledge that that Court
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16473:72"/>
hath to deale in Å¿uch buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, and alÅ¿o of the competencie of skill, that is in the Judges &amp; ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours of thoÅ¿e Courts, correÅ¿pondent to theÅ¿e cauÅ¿es, more than is in the Judges and ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours of the other Courts, for the deciding and determining of theÅ¿e matters. For, albeit otherwiÅ¿e they are very wiÅ¿e and Å¿ufficient men in the underÅ¿tanding of their owne profeÅ¿Å¿ion, yet have they Å¿mall skill or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in matters pertaining to the Civile profeÅ¿Å¿ion: for that there is nothing written in their Bookes of theÅ¿e mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, more than is to be gathered out of a few Statutes of former time, whoÅ¿e drift was not to open any doore unto them, to enter upon the admirall profeÅ¿Å¿ion, but to preÅ¿erue the Kings JuriÅ¿diction from the Admirall incroachment, as may by the Å¿aid Statutes appeare; whereas contrarily, the Civile Law hath Å¿undry titles included in the body thereof, concerning theÅ¿e kindes of cauÅ¿es; whereupon the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Law have largely commented, and others have made Å¿everall Tractates thereof: So that, by all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, theÅ¿e men are more fit and better furniÅ¿hed to deale in this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, than any men of any other profeÅ¿Å¿ion, as having, beÅ¿ides the Å¿trength of their owne wit, other mens helpes and labours to relie upon.</p>
                     <p>BeÅ¿ides, this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e many times concerns not only our owne countrey-men, but alÅ¿o Å¿trangers, who are parties to the Å¿uit, who are borne, and doe live in countries ordered by the Civile Law, whereby they may bee preÅ¿umed to have more skill and better liking of that Law, than they can bee thought to have of our Lawes, and our proceedings: and therefore it were no indifferencie to call them from the triall of that Law, which they, in Å¿ome part know, and is the Law of their countrey (as it is almoÅ¿t to all ChriÅ¿ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome beÅ¿ides) to the triall of a Law which they know in no part, and is meere forraine unto them; Å¿pecially when the Princes of this Land have anciently allowed the Civile Law to be a Common Law, in theÅ¿e cauÅ¿es, as well to their owne Å¿ubjects, as it is to Å¿trangers.</p>
                     <p>Further, the avocating away of cauÅ¿es in this Å¿ort from
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16473:73"/>
one JuriÅ¿diction to another, Å¿pecially when the cauÅ¿e hath long depended in the Court from whence it is called, inÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as now it is ready for Å¿entence, or rather is paÅ¿t Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and Å¿tands at execution, cannot be but great injurie to the Å¿ubject after Å¿o much labour loÅ¿t, and money Å¿pent in waÅ¿te, to begin his Å¿uit anew againe: which is like to <hi>SyÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> puniÅ¿hment, who, when he hath with all his might, forced his Å¿tone up to the top of the hill, and Å¿o is (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe hopes) at an end of his labour; yet the Å¿tone rowles downe again on him, and Å¿o his Å¿econd labour (his Å¿trength being Å¿pent with the toyle of the firÅ¿t) is more grievous than the former was: which being Å¿emblably true in a poore Clyent, who hath his cauÅ¿e in hearing, there can be no equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this fiction, whereby a cauÅ¿e Å¿o neere ended, Å¿hould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine be put upon the Anvill, as though it were Å¿till rough worke and new to be begun.</p>
                     <p>And Å¿urely, as there is no equity in it, Å¿o there is no poÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility Å¿uch a fiction Å¿hould be maintained by Law; for that it hath no ground of reaÅ¿on to reÅ¿t his feete on. For if this be granted, that Å¿uch a fiction by Law may be made, then one of theÅ¿e abÅ¿urdities muÅ¿t needes follow, either that a Å¿hippe may arive in a place where no water is to carry it, or if that it arive according to the fiction, either the people, their houÅ¿es and their wealth Å¿hall be all overwhelmed in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the world was in <hi>Noahs</hi> Floud, &amp; <hi>Ducalions</hi> Deluge, and Å¿o no body there Å¿hall be left alive to make any bargain or contract with the Mariners &amp; Shipmen that arive there; or that the people that dwell there Å¿hall walk upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as people doe on land, which <hi>Peter</hi> himÅ¿elfe was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe, but had Å¿uncke, if ChriÅ¿t had not reacht his hand unto him, and therefore far leÅ¿Å¿e poÅ¿Å¿ible for any other man to doe. So that it may bee well Å¿aid (theÅ¿e things Å¿tanding as they doe) no Å¿uch fiction can hold, and that no action can be framed upon it; for as there is no Obligation of impoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible things, Å¿o there is no Action of things that neither Nature nor ReaÅ¿on will afford to be done: neither is it to the purpoÅ¿e that the maintainers of theÅ¿e fictions doe Å¿ay,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16473:73"/>
that in this caÅ¿e, the place where the contract is made is not conÅ¿iderable, which I take to be farre otherwiÅ¿e; for that, when that themÅ¿elves will convey a Marine cauÅ¿e from the Sea unto the Land, they will lay it to bee done in Å¿ome Å¿peciall place of a Countrie, bee the place never Å¿o unproper for Å¿uch an action: for that the foundation of theÅ¿e actions, is the place where they were done, as namely that they were done in the body of Å¿uch a Country, or Å¿uch a Country, and not upon the maine Sea, or beneath the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t bridge, that is upon any great river next the Sea. And therfore in two emulous JuriÅ¿dictions, when they are Å¿o di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, as that one is aÅ¿Å¿igned the Å¿ea, the other the land, the place of the action can in no Å¿ort be Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ed, and another Å¿upplyed in the roome thereof: <hi>Quod enim una via prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur, alia via non eÅ¿t permittendum, &amp; quod prohibitum eÅ¿t directo prohibetur etiam per obliguum:</hi> for if this were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then matter enough would bee offered to one JuriÅ¿di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to devour up the other, and the Law would be eaÅ¿ily eluded: which, to reÅ¿traine either of theÅ¿e JuriÅ¿dictions to their owne place, and to provide that one in his greatneÅ¿Å¿e doe not Å¿well up againÅ¿t the other, hath Å¿et either of them their bounds and limits which they Å¿hall not paÅ¿Å¿e: which, as it is the good proviÅ¿ion of the Law, Å¿o ought either Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿diction in all obedience to Å¿ubmit it Å¿elfe thereunto, for that the diminiÅ¿hing of either of them is a wrong to the Prince from whom they are derived, who is no leÅ¿Å¿e Lord of the Sea, than hee is King of the Land: and therefore, in no Å¿ort, Å¿uch liberty muÅ¿t be allowed to the one directly or indirectly, as that it Å¿hould be a Å¿poile unto the other; which would eaÅ¿ily come to paÅ¿Å¿e, if when as the Law alloweth not any man to Å¿ue a Marine matter by the ordinary courÅ¿e of the Lawes of this Land, yet a man will follow it by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. But where there is an uniformitie of JuriÅ¿dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as that it is all by Å¿ea and all by land, there may a thing be fained to bee done in one place, that was done in another place, without any mans prejudice, for that in this caÅ¿e the place is not traverÅ¿able (Å¿o it bee not in Criminall matters
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16473:74"/>
where time and place is required, that the accuÅ¿er doe not wander from place to place with the injurie of the accuÅ¿er) for howÅ¿oever the place and the action is altered, yet the truth of the cauÅ¿e remaineth one and the Å¿elfe Å¿ame Å¿till. And Å¿o farre as concerning actions of Trover in Admirall cauÅ¿es: Now it doth follow, that I Å¿hould Å¿peake of like prejudices that grow to the Å¿ame by actions of TreÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿e, but thoÅ¿e will I paÅ¿Å¿e over, for that in Å¿o Å¿mall a TreatiÅ¿e as this is, I cannot goe over all: and therefore will I onely put the Reader in minde, that there are more deviÅ¿es, riÅ¿ing out of the Common Law than one, that infeÅ¿t the Admiralty.

                     <p>FOr matters of Wils and Legacies, they are Å¿o proper to the triall of the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical Law of this Realm, that the profeÅ¿Å¿ors of the Common Law themÅ¿elves, doe oftentimes confeÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿ay, they have no more to doe therewith, than the Civilian hath to do with the knowledge of the matters of Franktenement: and yet even theÅ¿e matters of TeÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Legacies, although Prohibitions be not Å¿o fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in them, as they are in the reÅ¿t of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall cauÅ¿es, yet they are not quite voide of them, &amp; that in Å¿ome points, wherein the very life and eÅ¿Å¿ence of a Will doth Å¿tand.</p>
                     <p>For whereas the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> knowing how Å¿ubject matters of Wils are to forgerie and corruption on the one Å¿ide, and Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ion and concealment on the other Å¿ide, to meet with all craft and Å¿ubtilty whatÅ¿oever, which might Å¿eize on them, did moÅ¿t carefully provide, that there Å¿hould be Å¿even witneÅ¿Å¿es, at the leaÅ¿t, preÅ¿ent at the making of every Will &amp; TeÅ¿tament, except it were in time of Å¿ome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall plague or Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e, when Å¿o many witneÅ¿Å¿es could not conveniently be had together, for fear of infection, or that it
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16473:74"/>
were in the Countrie, where there are Å¿mall multitude of people.

It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reduced the whole number of thoÅ¿e Å¿even witneÅ¿Å¿es, unto two onely, agreeably to the Law of God, and the Law of Nations, where that number of witneÅ¿Å¿es is allowed, as competent to prove any matter, Å¿o that the Å¿ame witneÅ¿Å¿es be honeÅ¿t and credible perÅ¿ons, Å¿uch whoÅ¿e faith is not doubted of. The Common Lawyers, becauÅ¿e themÅ¿elves in Å¿undry matters very dangerouÅ¿ly many times admit one witneÅ¿Å¿e, and give him full credit, and that in matters of great weight and importance, (as though all Å¿hould bee Å¿quared to their rule, and framed to their compaÅ¿Å¿e) if an EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Judge in the probate of a Will, contrary to the rules of his owne Law, will not admit the teÅ¿timony of one witneÅ¿Å¿e, they forthwith fling out a Prohibition againÅ¿t him, as though he had done an offence againÅ¿t the Crowne and dignitie, in that he doth not allow thoÅ¿e number of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿es in the Probate of a Will, that the Common Lawes of this land allow almoÅ¿t in every matter.</p>

as though the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Judge thereby took upon him to decree which lands were deviÅ¿able by Will, &amp; which not, or would by his probate adde a Å¿trength unto the Will, to make the deviÅ¿e good or bad, whereas on the contrary part, the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Judge by this act doth only teÅ¿tifie, that Å¿uch a perÅ¿on made Å¿uch a Will, &amp; that the Å¿ame was proved before himÅ¿elfe under his TeÅ¿te, for his laÅ¿t Will &amp; TeÅ¿tament: but for the validity of the Will it Å¿elf, &amp; the Legacies and deviÅ¿es therein, whether they were of lands or tenements, or of goods or chattels, the Probate it Å¿elfe worketh nothing, but leaveth that to the Law, Common or EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall, according as the bequeÅ¿t belongeth to either of them, whether it be good &amp; vailable in Law, or no: for it oftentimes falleth out, notwithÅ¿tanding the Wil be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully proved before the Ordinary, yet the bequeÅ¿ts are not good, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reÅ¿pect of the perÅ¿on to whom the bequeÅ¿ts are made, or in reÅ¿pect of the thing that is not deviÅ¿able in all, or in part; as by the Common Law, lands in <hi>Capite</hi> cannot be deviÅ¿ed, more than for two parts, but in Socage the deviÅ¿e is good for all; and by the CuÅ¿tome of the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> &amp; Å¿ome other places of the Land, a man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath no more than his deaths part, and if hee doe, his bequeÅ¿t is void for the reÅ¿t; but in other places of the land a man may bequeath all. By the Civile Law a man can bequeath nothing to a Traytor, or an Heretick, or an unlawfull Colledge, or Company (unleÅ¿Å¿e perhaps it be for the aliment, or maintenance of them in extreame poverty, that they die not for hunger, which is the worke of charitie) and if he doe, the legacie thereof is void to all intents &amp; purpoÅ¿es. So then, the Probate of the Ordinarie in matters of land, neither helpeth, nor hindereth the right of the deviÅ¿e it Å¿elfe, but is a declaration onely of the dead mans doome uttered before Å¿uch &amp; Å¿uch witneÅ¿Å¿es: which taketh his Å¿trength not Å¿o much from the Probate, as from the Law, and is teÅ¿tified onely by the Probate, that the Å¿ame was declared by the TeÅ¿tator, in the preÅ¿ence of the witneÅ¿Å¿es therein named, to be his true and laÅ¿t Will. So that no man herein is to be offended with the Ordinary, as preÅ¿uming of a matter not appertaining unto him, (for his teÅ¿tification in all Law and conÅ¿cience doth belong unto him, to give allowance Å¿o farre unto the defuncts Will, as it is avouched before him to be his laÅ¿t act &amp; deed in that behalfe) but rather they are in this caÅ¿e to thanke the Ordinary, that he by that act of his hath preÅ¿erved the memorie of that, which otherwiÅ¿e perhaps would

Thus much notwithÅ¿tanding is recorded, that by reaÅ¿on of the Arian incendiaries, a compleat number of the Canons of this Councell was Å¿o rarely found, that <hi>AthanaÅ¿ius</hi> himÅ¿elfe, who was preÅ¿ent at the Synod, was forc't to Å¿end into theÅ¿e parts, to the BiÅ¿hop of Rome that then was, to deÅ¿ire from him a perfect copie, becauÅ¿e in the EaÅ¿terne world, few or none had eÅ¿caped the fire of the Arians. This wee have out of thoÅ¿e EpiÅ¿tles, which are Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to have paÅ¿t betweene Pope <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>AthanaÅ¿ius</hi> concerning the burning of the decrees of this firÅ¿t <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But be theÅ¿e Canons how they will, yet a moÅ¿t expreÅ¿Å¿e monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this <hi>Quadripartite</hi> diviÅ¿ion of Church dues, may be noted out of an Arabick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Councell of <hi>Antioch, Canon</hi> 25.

                           <p>Concerning the originall of a PariÅ¿h in theÅ¿e two former Acceptions, it may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> to bee a device of the ancient Roman BiÅ¿hops, and to have beene derived from them to other Nations. But a PariÅ¿h may be alÅ¿o taken for Å¿uch a part of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿e, which is limited to Å¿ome reÅ¿identiarie incumbent, allowed by the BiÅ¿hop, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Church dues in his owne right. And this conÅ¿ideration of a PariÅ¿h moÅ¿t of all agreeth with thoÅ¿e which we now have. And it may very well be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, that theÅ¿e later PariÅ¿hes have had their beginning from the inconveniences of the former. And the deÅ¿ignement and limitation of theÅ¿e, how ever it might have Å¿peciall encouragement from the devotion of lay men, yet the principall Å¿troke was alwayes given by the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, to whom it pertained to conÅ¿ecrate the Churches, and make them baptiÅ¿teriall. And that the dividing of PariÅ¿hes Å¿hould of right belong unto EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall men, it may be the more reaÅ¿onable, becauÅ¿e the firÅ¿t that ever divided any PariÅ¿hes were the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man BiÅ¿hops, and they did not onely Å¿o, but alÅ¿o gave direction to other Prelates in their Å¿everall Provinces to doe the like, oÅ¿pecially if that be true, which wee have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cited out of that EpiÅ¿tle of Pope <hi>Denis</hi> to the SpaniÅ¿h BiÅ¿hop.

                           <p>The principall HiÅ¿toriographer of whom wee are to conÅ¿ider in this caÅ¿e, muÅ¿t bee <hi>Aimoine,</hi> who wrote the Storie of the <hi>French</hi> Kings, and what was delivered in his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle concerning the times wee aime at, for the moÅ¿t part, made up the Bookes of thoÅ¿e Writers that Å¿ucceeded, for Å¿ome certaine centuries of yeares. This <hi>Aimoine (Stephen</hi> Å¿aith) maketh no mention of that Act of <hi>Martel:</hi> 'tis true, neither maketh he mention of any Sacriledge at all, no not Å¿o much as <hi>Stephen</hi> himÅ¿elfe, and all Writers beleeve that <hi>Martel</hi> was guilty of: And I Å¿hould wonder if hee had, for <hi>Aimoine</hi> lived in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and what he wrote concerning him and his anceÅ¿tours, hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Autmare</hi> Chaplaine to the Å¿ame <hi>Charles,</hi> and this is too neere the time of <hi>Martel</hi> for a true HiÅ¿torian. Indeede the lives of pious Princes may be written before their deaths, and if there happen an unworthy paÅ¿Å¿age, it is not corrected in their Storie, but their ConverÅ¿ation: But when a great King proves not good, his firÅ¿t HiÅ¿torians muÅ¿t be worÅ¿e, for no Subject may dare to write what Å¿uch a Soveraigne could commit. And therefore if an ill Act occurre, the HiÅ¿torian muÅ¿t diÅ¿Å¿emble or defend it; for what e're be after thought of great mens actions, yet when they are newly done, either they muÅ¿t not be mentioned, or if they be, they muÅ¿t be magnified. Therefore <hi>Autmare,</hi> who depended upon <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, muÅ¿t not tell Å¿uch tales of his Grandfather. And for this cauÅ¿e it is, that when <hi>Aimoine</hi> Å¿peakes of <hi>Martel,</hi> he Å¿tyles him <hi>virum Å¿agaciÅ¿simum,</hi> and <hi>virum egregium,</hi> adding moreover that his atchievements were accompliÅ¿hed <hi>ChriÅ¿to in omnibus praeÅ¿ide:</hi> See <hi>lib. 4. c.</hi> 57. where alÅ¿o relating his victories, he compareth the Å¿iege of <hi>Avignon</hi> to that of <hi>Iericho,</hi> as if <hi>Charles</hi> had march't on like thoÅ¿e great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> and the wals of <hi>Avignon</hi> had fallen downe like thoÅ¿e of <hi>Iericho</hi> at the very Å¿ound of <hi>Martels</hi> Trumpets.

This <hi>Dupleix</hi> was a later writer than the reÅ¿t, and one that hopeth to bee accounted a better, as it Å¿eemeth by the cenÅ¿ure, which in his Preface hee paÅ¿Å¿eth upon thoÅ¿e who wrote before him. But let us heare what hee Å¿aith in defence of <hi>Martel: D'ailleurs ils furent encore plus offenses de ce qu' apres la journee de Tours</hi> (Å¿o the <hi>French</hi> call this expedition of <hi>Charles) il recompenÅ¿a la NobleÅ¿Å¿e de partie des diÅ¿mes du Clerge a vec promeÅ¿Å¿e de reÅ¿titution: de laquelle de puts il ne tint compte. Mais en cela l'ingratitude &amp; l'avarice du ClergÃ© eÅ¿t plus blaÅ¿mable que l'entrepriÅ¿e de Charles. Car n' eÅ¿toit il pas raiÅ¿onnable que ceux qui apres beaucoup de deÅ¿pence avoient exposÃ© Å¿i genereuÅ¿ement lour vie pour la de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenÅ¿e de l'EgliÅ¿e fuÅ¿Å¿ent recompenÅ¿es de quelque petit portion du revenu d'icelle? &amp;c.</hi> Hee granteth the paÅ¿Å¿age, But (Å¿aith hee) in this the ingratitude and avarice of the Clergie is more to be blamed, than the enterpriÅ¿e of <hi>Charles,</hi> for was it not good reaÅ¿on, that thoÅ¿e who beÅ¿ide their coÅ¿t and charges, had Å¿o generouÅ¿ly hazarded their lives for the defence of the Church, Å¿hould bee rewarded with Å¿ome Å¿mall portion of the revenue thereof? &amp;c. Wee anÅ¿wer, that the deÅ¿igne it Å¿elfe was truely honourable, but for <hi>Charles</hi> to free the Church from a forraigne Foe, and be a Barbarian himÅ¿elfe at home, makes his atchievment very improper, and utterly darkens the reputation of Å¿o great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queÅ¿t.</p>
                           <p>Thus wee Å¿ee, that it is generally beleeved by the <hi>French</hi> Writers of later times, that their <hi>Martel</hi> diÅ¿tributed the Church Tythes to his men of warre, and that without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tauration. And if it be asked, from what head theÅ¿e moderne HiÅ¿toriographers could deduce that paÅ¿Å¿age, whereof the ancient had made no mention; it may be replyed, that though this were not publickly recorded by the old Writers <hi>Aimoine</hi> and the reÅ¿t, yet it might remaine in the Notes of private men, and being delivered from hand to hand, might be reÅ¿erved for Å¿uch a time as could indure the relation.</p>

This manner of baptizing the ancient Church entertained, from the example of our Saviour who baptized <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Iordan.</hi> And Å¿ome Å¿ay, that this was very tolerable in thoÅ¿e EaÅ¿terne parts; but certaine it is, that it was moÅ¿t co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>venient for that time, becauÅ¿e their Converts were many, and men of yeares. A reaÅ¿on alÅ¿o may be, for that thoÅ¿e ages were otherwiÅ¿e unprovided of Fonts and Å¿uch conveniences which are now in uÅ¿e: and this hath beene a cauÅ¿e, why this manner of baptizing was reÅ¿um'd in after-times, and other places, for our venerable <hi>Bede</hi> telleth us of Å¿ome that were baptized heere in <hi>England</hi> in the River <hi>Swale,</hi> which runneth through a part of <hi>YorkeÅ¿hire,</hi> in the <hi>North Riding,</hi> and hee giveth the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on: <hi>Nondum enim Oratoria vel BaptiÅ¿teria in ipÅ¿o exordio naÅ¿centis thi EccleÅ¿ia poterant adificari.

                           <p>The dayes we now live in have no other remainder of this Rite of Baptizing in Rivers and Fountaines, than the very name; for hence it is, that wee call our veÅ¿Å¿els that containe the water of BaptiÅ¿me Fonts, or Fountaines.</p>
                           <p>This cuÅ¿tome of Baptizing in Rivers and Fountaines being diÅ¿continued, Fonts were erected in private houÅ¿es; but the violent perÅ¿ecutions of thoÅ¿e times barr'd the ChriÅ¿tians of that convenience, therefore their next recourÅ¿e was to woods and devious places, and there they accommodated themÅ¿elves with Å¿uch BaptiÅ¿terials as they could. In more peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ages they drew nearer, and made bold to build their Fonts a little diÅ¿tance from the Church; afterwards they obtained, that they might bee Å¿et in the Church-porch; and at laÅ¿t got them into the Church. But they were not placed in every Church; for at the firÅ¿t they were onely found in Cities where the BiÅ¿hop himÅ¿elfe reÅ¿ided, and onely in the great Church of Å¿uch a Citie; and though Service might be Å¿aid in the leÅ¿Å¿er MinÅ¿ters and rurall Churches, yet the right of Sepulture and BaptiÅ¿me belonged to the Cathedrall Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e it were in caÅ¿e of neceÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and it was therefore called the Mother-Church, becauÅ¿e that as the people in their Mothers wombe were borne Men, Å¿o in the Fonts of BaptiÅ¿me, as in the Churches wombe, they were borne ChriÅ¿tians. In Å¿ucceeding ages, when it was found that the Mother church was too farre diÅ¿tant from Å¿ome Villages, and Å¿o Å¿ituated, that in the Winter time the people could not repaire thither, conÅ¿ideration was had of this inconvenience, and the BiÅ¿hop tooke occaÅ¿ion from hence to transferre the right of BaptiÅ¿me and Sepulture to the Rurall Churches, and this, together with the right of Tythes, &amp;c. made it a Parochiall Church, of that kinde which wee now have. But becauÅ¿e alÅ¿o in many PariÅ¿hes Å¿ome Families liv'd Å¿o remote from their Church, that they could not conveniently frequent it, it was indulged to thoÅ¿e, that they might build themÅ¿elves either in or neere their manÅ¿ion-places a private Oratorie, reÅ¿erving for the moÅ¿t part, the right of BaptiÅ¿me and Sepulture to the PariÅ¿h-Church, which, in reÅ¿pect of theÅ¿e leÅ¿Å¿er Oratories, was to be accounted their BaptiÅ¿mall and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Church.

                        <p>That the admiration which theÅ¿e Religious Men did breed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves in the head of Princes and Popes, did procure appropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ParÅ¿onages, and Immunities from Tythes. And that the over-conceit which men had of Prayer above Preaching in the Church, was an adjuvant cauÅ¿e thereunto.</p>

                     <p>IN this zealous bounty of every degree towards theÅ¿e new Å¿orts of men, there are two undigeÅ¿ted Priviledges granted them, both of them Å¿o hurtfull and injurious to the Church of God, as never any was the like. The one was the Annexation or Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation of preÅ¿entative Benefices to theÅ¿e Religious HouÅ¿es: The other, the freeing of Å¿uch Lands or Hereditaments, as they held in Å¿undry PariÅ¿hes from the payment of Tythes to the ParÅ¿ons and Vicars thereof; to both of which the School-mens Divinity gave great advantage, as Å¿hall be Å¿hewed hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Either of theÅ¿e had their beginning of one roote, that is to Å¿ay, of this falÅ¿e ground, that Preaching, which is the moÅ¿t true, and moÅ¿t naturall foode of the Soule, in a Congregation that is come to the profeÅ¿Å¿ion of Religion already, and knowes but onely the Articles of the ChriÅ¿tian Faith, the Lords Prayer, the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, <note place="margin">Linwood provin, eiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, de of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic.

By which,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:16473:101"/>
and other like arguments, they tranÅ¿lated away that maintenance that was provided for the home PaÅ¿tors, (who by Gods owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titution, were to watch over their Soules) to forreine and Å¿trange Guides, who never communicated to their neceÅ¿sitie in any hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly comfort, but onely tooke the milke of the flock, and fed themÅ¿elves withall. But by this pretence of theirs, ought not Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to have beene diÅ¿graced; for albeit Prayer bee a neceÅ¿Å¿arie peece of Gods Å¿ervice, and Å¿o neceÅ¿sary, that the Soule of man is, as it were, dead without it, yet is it not <note n="â " place="margin">

This reaÅ¿on prevailed for all places in the firÅ¿t times, but in theÅ¿e laÅ¿t onely for Å¿ome, according to which it were unprofitable to goe about to convert the <hi>Indies</hi> no otherwiÅ¿e than by our Prayers. Yet even in thoÅ¿e primitive times, which had moÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to call for Preaching, we Å¿hall find that this duty was of rarer exerciÅ¿e, &amp; leÅ¿Å¿e Å¿olemnity than that of Prayer, as it may abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly be diÅ¿covered out of the Liturgies of both the Charches. And it is obÅ¿erveable, that where Preaching hath beene of the greateÅ¿t account, it hath bin Å¿o much beholden to Prayer, that it was not onely begun and ended, but alÅ¿o diÅ¿continued by devotion: For wee Å¿hall finde the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Fathers <hi>ChryÅ¿oÅ¿tome</hi> and <hi>BaÅ¿il</hi> of <hi>Seleucia</hi> at prayers in the middle of a Sermon: See the one in his 39. <hi>Orat.</hi> the other in his 3. <hi>Hom.</hi>

                     <p>Neither can it be thought that this number came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the Judiciall part of the Law, as a fit proportion to maintain one Tribe, out of the revenues of the other eleven Tribes: for that this number, or quotitie was revealed to be Gods long before the Law, and before there were any Å¿uch diviÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tribes among the people of IÅ¿raell; which then were not, but were parted afterward by <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> into families ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of the twelve Å¿onnes of <hi>Jacob.</hi> And therefore it is not to be preÅ¿umed, that the Law which came long after, imprinted a forme upon that, which was Å¿o long in beeing before there was any Law or Ceremony. But as the ApoÅ¿tles, or prime ChriÅ¿tians, vvhen as they did firÅ¿t change the day of the Sabbath by divine inÅ¿piration, or otherwiÅ¿e, from the day of the Creation, to the day of the ReÅ¿urrection, durÅ¿t not Å¿ubÅ¿titute any other day into the place of the firÅ¿t day, than a Å¿eaventh; for that the Lord had revealed his pleaÅ¿ure in many places of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as concerning that number, for his day of vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip, Å¿o that no other day could be appointed for his day
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:16473:110"/>
of worÅ¿hip than a Å¿eaventh: So neither durÅ¿t the good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians of the Primitive Church (moved no doubt with no other inÅ¿tinct then the other were, when they tranÅ¿lated this proviÅ¿ion of Tythes for their miniÅ¿tery from the JewiÅ¿h Church unto their owne Church) change the number of ten into another number beÅ¿ides, more or leÅ¿Å¿e: For that God had no leÅ¿Å¿e manifeÅ¿ted his will in Å¿undry parts of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as concerning this number, to be a number for the maintenance of his miniÅ¿trie, than he had declared his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure as concerning that other number to be a day for his honour, challenging it every where in the Scripture, in the very quotitie for his owne right, and counting it robberie if it were at any time with-holden from him. And therfore it may be well thought, the School-men herein did great wrong to the Church, who by their quaint diÅ¿tinctions brought this certaintie into an uncertaintie, which is no where to be found in the Scripture. Which I am more bold to Å¿peake, for that I Å¿ee Å¿ome have trod this path before me, and Å¿hewed by good demonÅ¿tration, that the turning of this quotitie into a competencie is a thing nothing warrantable by the word of God, but that the quotitie ought Å¿till to Å¿tand as a perpetuall right due to God and his Church. But hereof hitherto.</p>

And if theÅ¿e bodies doe both ingender and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, which are conceived Å¿o farre below in the Navell of the Earth, why is not Tythe due of them, aÅ¿well as it is of other fruits that are in the Å¿ummitie or heigth of the earth? Whether is it, that Gods hand leÅ¿Å¿e laboureth in the procre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of theÅ¿e Å¿ubterraneous bodies, than it doth in the ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and quickning of that fruit, that Å¿prings out of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per face of the Earth? But that is farre otherwiÅ¿e, for here in theÅ¿e upper fruites, one planteth, an other watereth, and God onely gives the increaÅ¿e: But in the other Minerall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, God alone doth all, for hee only is the planter, hee is the waterer, and he gives the increaÅ¿e alone.

And of all other kinde of Mettals, Gold is firÅ¿t remembred in the Scripture, immediately after the <note place="margin">GeneÅ¿. 2. verÅ¿. 11 &amp; 12.</note> creation of the world, Å¿o that God himÅ¿elfe may Å¿oeme to have a Å¿peciall regard of this Mettall above the reÅ¿t, for that this alone above all the reÅ¿t, by purifying is not diminiÅ¿hed. Or is it, that God loveth his MiniÅ¿ters leÅ¿Å¿e than other men, Å¿o that hee would have the Laity to have all the precious things of the earth, and his MiniÅ¿ters to have no part of any other thing, but that which is vulgar and common? But
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:16473:117"/>
how unlike that is, who Å¿ees not, when hee Å¿eeth that God hath committed unto them, the ineÅ¿timable treaÅ¿ures of his word; in compariÅ¿on where of, both theÅ¿e upper fruits of the earth, and thoÅ¿e hid treaÅ¿ures below, are meere droÅ¿Å¿e and corruption? and therefore it is not like, when he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them thoÅ¿e great matters, hee would deny unto them theÅ¿e Å¿maller bleÅ¿Å¿ings. Or is it, that there hath beene paid Tythes of the upper fruit of the earth already, and therefore cannot Tythe be twice demanded of one ground <note place="margin">Ca. ex parte de Decimis, &amp; ibi Ab. 18.</note> in one yeare, according to a new over-ruled doctrine? But that opinion is both contrary to Law many hundred yeares obtained in the Church without contradiction, whereby it is ordained, that as often as the earth fructifieth in one yeare, Å¿o often Å¿hall Tythes in the Å¿ame yeare bee paid of it: and alÅ¿o it is contrary to Divinitie and reaÅ¿on, that it Å¿hould bee otherwiÅ¿e. For when as God hath given thee more HarveÅ¿t or more Vintages in one yeare, is it not both godly and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onable, as God hath increaÅ¿ed his bleÅ¿Å¿ings towards thee, Å¿o thou alÅ¿o Å¿houldeÅ¿t riÅ¿e in thank fulneÅ¿Å¿e towards him? For, where every one hath received more grace or more favour, there ought he to be more thankfull, leÅ¿t God for lack of this correÅ¿pondencie in thankfulneÅ¿Å¿e, bring thy nine parts, for thine ingratitude towards him, to a tenth onely. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely Å¿o hee is able to doe, by Å¿ending deluge and drought upon the earth, by bringing barrenneÅ¿Å¿e upon it, by deÅ¿troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is Å¿prung out of the earth already, by Å¿torme and tempeÅ¿t, by the GraÅ¿hopper and the Caterpiller: for all this hath hee threatned to all thoÅ¿e that are unthankfull this way, neither is the Lords hand more Å¿hortned now than it was then. Whereas notwithÅ¿tanding to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hee hath promiÅ¿ed great kindneÅ¿Å¿e unto Å¿uch as Å¿hall pay their Tythes truely and cheerfully, as that hee will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the windowes of heaven, and powre out his bleÅ¿Å¿ings without meaÅ¿ure upon them. <hi>Hilarem enim datorem amat Deus.</hi> BeÅ¿ides this, the earth that bringeth out mettals in the matrix of the earth, is not that that bringeth out corne and graÅ¿Å¿e in the top of the earth: for that earth that is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:16473:117"/>
the mother of mettals, being preÅ¿t downe farre into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of the earth, can yeeld no Å¿uÅ¿tenance to thoÅ¿e fruits that grow Å¿o many fathoms above it, to which it conferres nothing Å¿ave that it doth Å¿upport and beare up that other earth, which nouriÅ¿heth the plants and fruits of the upper earth, whoÅ¿e Å¿uÅ¿tenance is not fetch't deep out of the earth, but is Å¿uckt out of that earth which is with in one cubit, or two of the top of the earth: which may eaÅ¿ily be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by thoÅ¿e fruits and trees that grow upon hard rockes neere to the top of the earth, whoÅ¿e food, although it be neere unto the top of the earth yet do they flouriÅ¿h, and Å¿tand faÅ¿t, as other trees and fruits doe, which have more fat and deepe mould under them. And therefore cannot the Tything of thoÅ¿e things which are above, excuÅ¿e the Tythe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the treaÅ¿ures that are below, albeit the concluÅ¿ion were true, that two things are not to be paid out of one ground in one yeare, for theÅ¿e are not one ground, and the concluÅ¿ion it Å¿elfe is erroneous, and therefore I conclude this point thus: Since Mettals and minerals, and other Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous bodies are in no leÅ¿Å¿e Obligation to God, than other fruits of the earth are, there muÅ¿t be no leÅ¿Å¿e Tythes paid of them, than are of other fruits of the earth: for that theÅ¿e are the inward fruits of the earth, as well as thoÅ¿e are the outward, and therefore of like things, there muÅ¿t be like judgement and like conÅ¿equence.

                     <p>ANd now becauÅ¿e I am in this matter of Tythes, I will Å¿hape an anÅ¿wer to one doubt that is made, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Tythes of Turves, that is, of earth diÅ¿poÅ¿ed, and prepared for fewell, which are Å¿aid not to be Tythe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and that upon this reaÅ¿on: That Tythes are not paid of the earth it Å¿elfe, but of thoÅ¿e things which Å¿pring out of the earth: which opinion is true, if it be underÅ¿tood of earth
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:16473:118"/>
not Å¿eparated from the body, and maÅ¿Å¿e of the reÅ¿t of the earth. For if Tythes Å¿hould be yearely paid thereof, as it is paid of other things that grow out of the earth, all the whole earth in a Å¿hort time would become the Clergies. But if it be meant of earth that is Å¿evered from the reÅ¿t of the maÅ¿Å¿e, and globe of the earth, then is it otherwiÅ¿e. For that earth that is thus Å¿evered from the other earth, is no more part of that earth from whence it is Å¿evered, than a mans hand, or leg being Å¿ever'd fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the body, is part of his body after it is cut off from it. And therefore of this earth Å¿o provided for fewell, may Tythes as well be paid, as of any other fewell of wood, cole, or otherwiÅ¿e that is provided to be burnt. For there is one reaÅ¿on of things, when they are united together in one body, and another of thoÅ¿e things, when they are divided from the Å¿ame bodie: for Å¿o long as they are in one and the Å¿elfe Å¿ame body, they follow the nature of the whole, but when they are divided, then is there another conÅ¿ideration of them. <hi>Separatorum enim Å¿eperata eÅ¿t ratio, &amp; ex Å¿eperatis non infertur de uno ad aliud.</hi>

yet reaÅ¿on telleth us, that is comparative that hath a poÅ¿itive under it, and a Å¿uperlative above it: and therefore that is comparative waÅ¿te, barren, or heath, in reÅ¿pect whereof there is Å¿ome over ground more or leÅ¿Å¿e, vvaÅ¿te, heath, or barren, Å¿o that it hath Å¿imply and poÅ¿itively in it Å¿ome condition of heath, waÅ¿te, or barren: but if it hath nothing of any of theÅ¿e qualities in it, then is it neither heath, barren or waÅ¿te, howÅ¿oever long otherwiÅ¿e it hath lien unmanured, and not turned to tillage: For it is not the turning of a ground to tillage that makes it heath, barren, or waÅ¿te, but it is the ill diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of the ground it Å¿elfe, Å¿ubject to theÅ¿e inconveniences, that cauÅ¿eth it not to be turned to tillage; for no man will willingly till that, where the gaine of the tillage will not quit the coÅ¿t and labour of husbandrie, as for the moÅ¿t part it falleth out theÅ¿e grounds that they doe not.</p>

                     <p>Although heath ground, and barren ground be almoÅ¿t Synonomies, yet to Å¿peake properly, heath is as it were an effect of barrenneÅ¿Å¿e, for that there is no ground that bringeth forth heath, but for the moÅ¿t part it is barren.

Our forefathers anciently compriÅ¿ed all theÅ¿e three un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one name, calling them them all by the name of <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> that is, new-broken-up-ground, not onely becauÅ¿e they were not broken up in the memorie of man before, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o, for that being eared, they yeelded little or no fruit at all: and therefore the interpreters of the Law defining what <hi>Novalia</hi> are, Å¿ay, that they are Å¿uch grounds as before the tillage therof were <hi>inutilia;</hi> &amp; example them out, in Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, <note place="margin">C. commiÅ¿Å¿um de decimis ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo inutilia.</note> MarÅ¿hes, Thickets, and Å¿uch other unprofitable ground, as out of which before the Å¿tocking of them up, and converting them to tillage, the Church tooke little or no benefit at all. And thoÅ¿e are the Å¿ame or coÅ¿en German to thoÅ¿e which this Statute calleth heath, barren and waÅ¿te, for they are one and the very Å¿elfe Å¿ame vvith them, in all the chiefe points, for which they are excepted out of the Statute.</p>
                     <p>So then now, there is no further queÅ¿tion what is heath, barren, and vvaÅ¿te ground, but who Å¿hall trie the matter of this quality; whether the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Judge, in whoÅ¿e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion this triall hath beene untill now of late, that under colour of this Statute, it hath bin incroched upon as it may appeare by all the Titles of the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Law, where there is any mention of the Tythes of new broken upground, and the decrees of the Lawgivers in the Å¿ame, betweene the MonaÅ¿tories challenging them by graunt, and the Parochian MiniÅ¿ters of the PariÅ¿hes vvhere they grew, claiming the Å¿ame by right: Or the Temporall Judges vvhoÅ¿e is the CogniÅ¿ance of the Tytle, and Tenure of the ground, as alÅ¿o is the Å¿etting, letting, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Å¿elling, and other alienating of the Å¿ame.</p>
                     <p>For the point it Å¿elfe, the Statute maketh no mention but paÅ¿Å¿eth it over with Å¿ilence; and therefore it is to be preÅ¿umed that it meant, that it Å¿hould there reÅ¿t, where it was before the making of the Statute: for the Statute was not made in derogation of the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that were before; but in affirmance thereof, as the whole drift of the Å¿aid Statute doth Å¿hew.</p>

And if the Statute had meant otherwiÅ¿e, it vvould Å¿urely have expreÅ¿Å¿ed it either in the proviÅ¿o it Å¿elf, or after in the derogatory clauÅ¿e; where it maketh an enumeration of Å¿uch things as it intended Å¿hould be exempted from the tryall of the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Law, and by vertue of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, Å¿hould not be compriÅ¿ed under the Å¿ame, among which there is no word of this proviÅ¿o, or any other in the Å¿ame Statute before named.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it unto the purpoÅ¿e, that the Common Law of this Land taketh knowledge of the Tenure and Title of Lands, and Å¿uch other complements belonging to the Å¿ame; for theÅ¿e things that are here in queÅ¿tion, are no part of thoÅ¿e Legall EÅ¿Å¿ences, which the Law requireth to the Tytle and Tenure thereof, as is Fee-Å¿imple, Fee-taile, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of like nature, according to the learning of that Law, but theÅ¿e are certaine accidents over and beÅ¿ide the Tenure of the Land which may be preÅ¿ent or abÅ¿ent without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie of the Tytle: as God many times turnes flouds into wilderneÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿prings of vvater againe into drineÅ¿Å¿e, and a fruitfull Land makes hee barren for the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of them that dwell therein, and yet the Tytle or Tenure of the ground is not changed, by theÅ¿e changes of qualities, but remaines the Å¿elfe Å¿ame that it was: Å¿o that theÅ¿e things are no more Å¿ubject to the ordering of the Common Law, than it is in the Common Law, to judge and determine what mould is white and what is blacke; what ground will beare wheat, vvhat barley, vvhat oats; for theÅ¿e things are no matters of skill of Law, that they need to be fetcht out of bookes, but they are matters of common experience which every country man can as well skill of, as the greateÅ¿t Lawyer that is, and therefore the Law in this caÅ¿e is not deÅ¿irous of any curious proofe, but contenteth it Å¿elfe onely vvith the depoÅ¿itions of two or three honeÅ¿t men, which Å¿peake Å¿enÅ¿ibly and feelingly to the point that is in hand, vvhich is enough to direct any wiÅ¿e Judge in his Å¿entence, Å¿o that it needs not theÅ¿e long circumÅ¿tances of twelve men to teach the Judge what, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:16473:121"/>
how truly the witneÅ¿Å¿es have depoÅ¿ed. For if every qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the ground reÅ¿teth in the mouth of twelve men onely, then Å¿hould no man be able to Å¿ay out of the mouth of a witneÅ¿Å¿e, and pronounce thereupon, this ground is mountaine, this is plaine, this is medowe, this is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, unleÅ¿Å¿e hee were warranted by the verdit of twelve men thereunto: which if it be an abÅ¿urditie to hold, then Å¿ure it is a like abÅ¿urditie to Å¿ay, that barren, &amp; heath, waÅ¿te cannot be pronounced without a Jurie, for that theÅ¿e things are like obvious to Å¿enÅ¿e, and of like qualitie as the others are.</p>
                     <p>And I pray you, when they have drawne it unto their tryall, what do they in effect otherwiÅ¿e than the EcclehaÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Judge would or Å¿hould have done, if it had remained Å¿till under him? for do they give credit Å¿imply to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the Jurie, as touching that which hath beene decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and pleaded in the cauÅ¿e before them, or do not the Judges themÅ¿elves rather make a briefe of all that hath beene pleaded in the cauÅ¿e before them, and thereof make as it were a verdit, and put the Å¿ame in the mouth of the twelve for their verdit, before they goe from the barre? So that the whole weight of the cauÅ¿e Å¿tandeth rather in the Judges direction, in Å¿uch Å¿ort as it is at the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Law, than it doth in the mouth of the Jurie; for the Jurie men for the moÅ¿t part, are Å¿imple people, and Å¿carce foure of the twelve underÅ¿tand their evidence: Å¿o that it may Å¿eeme rather to be a matter of Å¿uperfluitie than of good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, to referre a matter to their verdit, vvhen as they Å¿ay no other thing, than what the Judge taught them before; <hi>Stultum eÅ¿t enimid facere per plura, quod fieri poteÅ¿t per pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciora:</hi> for albeit perhaps Å¿ome capricious fellow of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, upon the confidence of his owne braine, Å¿ometimes Å¿tart aÅ¿ide from that which the Judge hath told him, and draw the reÅ¿t of his fellowes, as Å¿o many Å¿heepe after him; yet for the moÅ¿t part the Judges voice is their direction, their loadÅ¿tone, and the North pole to guide them in this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e.

the thing it Å¿elfe naturally was liable to ordinary courÅ¿e of the Law, as other things of like nature are, and the Statute comes in derogation of their ordinary courÅ¿e: as in this caÅ¿e, great timber anciently was no leÅ¿Å¿e tytheable than Å¿mall trees are, and Å¿o by nature ought to be, if the Statute were not to the contrary; yet notwithÅ¿tanding theÅ¿e limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Å¿ame, if great wood bee cut downe to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uÅ¿e than to Å¿ale, as to build, or to burne to a mans owne uÅ¿e, a prohibition in this caÅ¿e lyeth, and yet is there no Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of reaÅ¿on to extend it, nor any abÅ¿urdity would follow, if it were not extended; for here is neither money Å¿ought, (which gave occaÅ¿ion unto the Law-givers to make this Statute of exemption) neither is it an unnaturall thing, for to pay Tythes of great wood; for before this time they were paid, and by the Law of God, it Å¿eemes, they ought to bee <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 6.</note> paid; for that he that is taught, ought to communicate to him that teacheth him in all things: and therefore Å¿ince the reaÅ¿on that moved the Law-givers to order it Å¿o in one caÅ¿e, ceaÅ¿eth in the other, there is no reaÅ¿on of exemption; and when there is not an Identitie of reaÅ¿on in the things that are in demand, there can no Å¿ound inference be brought in from the one to the other, for of Å¿everall things, there is a Å¿everall reaÅ¿on, and a Å¿everall conÅ¿equence; neither can there bee framed thereof a good implication, either poÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, or remotively: neither hath this interpretation of theirs any warrant of Law for it, Å¿ave that it hath beene Å¿o defined and decided: but what is that to the purpoÅ¿e, if it hath beene wreÅ¿ted and wronged contrary to the true Å¿enÅ¿e of the Statute, and that by thoÅ¿e that take benefit thereby, whoÅ¿e partiality being taken away, the thing it Å¿elfe would eaÅ¿ily turne againe to his owne nature, and right would take place?</p>
                     <p>The reaÅ¿on they yeeld for the exemption of great woods of the ages aforeÅ¿aid, although to themÅ¿elves it be plauÅ¿ible, yet to others it is Å¿trange, as namely, that great Trees are <note place="margin">Plowd. in Soby contra Molyns.</note> part of the Free-hold, and that men uÅ¿e not to pay Tythes of their free-hold, but of thoÅ¿e things which Å¿pring out of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:16473:122"/>
their free hold, as out of Corne, GraÅ¿Å¿e, Fruit, and Å¿uch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whereas indeed the talleÅ¿t Timber tree, that is, if it were as high as the higheÅ¿t Cedar in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> is no more part of the inheritance or free-hold, than the loweÅ¿t bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that groweth in the field; for they are both equally part of the ground wherein they grow, and doe take alike nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿hment and Å¿uÅ¿tenance from the Å¿ame; neither doe they differ in that they are trees the one from the other, <hi>Å¿ecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dÃ¹m magis &amp; minus,</hi> as the Logicians Å¿ay; but in that, the one is a great tree, and the other a Å¿mall Å¿hrub: and the cauÅ¿e of this proviÅ¿ion here in <hi>England</hi> for theÅ¿e great trees, was not for that one was more of the inheritance than the other, but for that the one yeeldeth more profite to the common-wealth than the other, and therefore they have made the cutting downe of the one, more penall than the other: as in like caÅ¿e by the Civile Law, whoÅ¿oever privily cutteth downe, or barketh a Vine, an Olive, or a Fig-tree, or doth <note place="margin">ff.

So that in the reckoning of the Civile Law, Timber Å¿tands not onely in the nature of the wood it Å¿elfe, but is in the deÅ¿tination and purpoÅ¿e of the owner, who according to his good liking may make that wood, which is fit for timber, fire-wood, or timber: which if it were Å¿o in account with the great Lawyers of this Land, the Church Å¿hould have more Tythes of Wood ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for fewell, and leÅ¿Å¿e Å¿uite for the Å¿ame.</p>
                     <p>As they exempt the bodies of great Trees above xx. <note place="margin">Plowd. ut Å¿upr.</note> yeares growth, from payment of Tythes, Å¿o alÅ¿o they free the boughes thereof, upon this reaÅ¿on, that the boughes thereof are fit and Å¿erviceable for building, which although happily may be in Å¿ome of them that are next to the Trunck of the tree, yet it is farre otherwiÅ¿e in thoÅ¿e that are more remote from the Å¿ame, whereof there can bee no other uÅ¿e, than to burne: and therefore the Law preciÅ¿ely holds, in caÅ¿e where wood is bequeathed, by which is meant fire-wood onely, unleÅ¿Å¿e the TeÅ¿tator otherwiÅ¿e expreÅ¿Å¿e his minde, the lops of timber trees, which the Law cals <hi>Supera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta</hi>

And therefore be the fault what it may be, that the words of the Diffamation do Å¿ound unto, as long as it Å¿tands but in words, and the partie doth not take upon him to juÅ¿tifie the matter that is compriÅ¿ed under thoÅ¿e words, and doth Å¿eeke but for the puniÅ¿hment of the Å¿lande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous words onely, Å¿o long it is to be tried at the Spirituall Law; for the Law Å¿peaketh in generall in caÅ¿es of Diffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, where puniÅ¿hment of Å¿inne onely is required: Å¿o that where a man is called Traitor, Felon, or murtherer, or any other crime belonging unto the Common-Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one of them words of great diffamation, Å¿o the partie therein Å¿eeke puniÅ¿hment onely, and not his private intereÅ¿t, there the Spirituall Law is to hold plea thereof. For where the Law doth not diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h, there neither ought wee to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h: but the Law hath Å¿aid in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that cauÅ¿es of Diffamation, whoÅ¿e proÅ¿ecution is thus qualified, do belong unto the tryall of the Spirituall Law: and therefore even thoÅ¿e caÅ¿es before remembred where the partie followeth this kinde of proÅ¿ecutions, ought by
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16473:127"/>
that Law to belong unto the Spirituall Court, as on the contrarie Å¿ide, Spirituall cauÅ¿es of Diffamation being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to a pecuniarie end ought to be ordered in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Court,</p>
                     <p>But where any man takes upon him to juÅ¿tifie the crime that hee hath objected, there either Court is to hold plea of the crime that properly belongeth to that Court, for that now words are no longer in queÅ¿tion, but matter is in try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, whether the partie diffamed hath indeed committed that offence that he is charged withall or no; which can be tryed in no other Court, than in that to which it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly appertaine. And that this was the courÅ¿e anciently held in matters of Diffamation betweene the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall and Common Law, it is manifeÅ¿t by the Statute of 2. of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Edw. 3. c. 11.</note> the 3. chapter 11. where although the Statute taxeth the perverÅ¿e dealing of Å¿uch, who when they had beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted before the Sherifes in their Returne, and after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by InqueÅ¿t before the JuÅ¿tice of the AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿e, did Å¿ue the indictors in the Spirituall Court, Å¿urmiÅ¿ing againÅ¿t them that they had diffamed them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that caÅ¿e forbad the like Å¿uits; for that juÅ¿tice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by was hindered, and many people were feared to indict Offenders: yet that Statute plainly Å¿heweth that in all other caÅ¿es of Diffamation riÅ¿ing out of Temporall crimes beÅ¿ide this, the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Law had the cogniÅ¿ance: and that this was forbidden, it was not for that words of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, could not be cenÅ¿ured at the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Law, when puniÅ¿hment of Å¿in onely is required, but for that it was not fit that thoÅ¿e things, which had beene once ordered in one Court, Å¿hould be called againe to examination in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and therefore the generall proceeding in matters of Diffamation, is not there prohibited, but the particular croÅ¿Å¿ing of matters after judgement is there reprehended.</p>
                     <p>So that the diÅ¿tinction whereof I formerly Å¿pake, which taketh upon it to determine when a caÅ¿e of Diffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is of the Temporall cogniÅ¿ance, and when of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall, cannot here take place: for that it is contrary to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:16473:128"/>
the former Statute or Decree that divided theÅ¿e caÅ¿es into Temporall or EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall cogniÅ¿ance by the varietie of the proÅ¿ecution thereof, and that it is contrarie to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient practiÅ¿e that hath confirmed this proÅ¿ecution in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Court, but eÅ¿pecially in the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Court, which hath Å¿till holden the triall of Å¿uch Diffamations wherein Å¿in hath bin only Å¿ought to be puniÅ¿hed, untill now of late, that men have Å¿tept over the bankes, of theirautho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and confounded either JuriÅ¿diction with the promiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous acts one of another; when as the Statute it Å¿elfe is plaine, that the Authors of this Statute or Decree, whether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever you call it, which Å¿et theÅ¿e bounds to either Law, in proceeding upon matters of Diffamation, reÅ¿pected not Å¿o much the qualitie of the crime, upon which the Diffamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grew, as the manner of proceeding therein, ayming in the one at publique vendict, which is to be Å¿ought out of the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Law, and in the other at private intereÅ¿t, which is to be had out of the Temporall Law.</p>
                     <p>Neither is an Action of Diffamation, a matter of Å¿o light eÅ¿teeme or qualitie, (a mans fame or good name being in equall ballance with his life) as that it Å¿hould be drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to be attendant on any other action that is of Å¿maller weight or importance than it Å¿elfe is: for this is one of thoÅ¿e Actions which for the Å¿peciall preheminence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are called <hi>Actiones praejudiciales,</hi> that is, Å¿uch that draw Å¿maller cauÅ¿es unto them, but themÅ¿elves are drawne of none other, but Å¿uch as are like principall, or greater than themÅ¿elves are. So that unleÅ¿Å¿e the manner of proceeding bring theÅ¿e cauÅ¿es under the compaÅ¿Å¿e of the Common Law, in Å¿uch Å¿ort as I have before Å¿hewed, the coupling of them with another matter of the Å¿ame Law, will hardly bring them under the triall thereof: for that there be few actions greater then it Å¿elfe is, Å¿o that if the crime be Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iaÅ¿ticall, howÅ¿oever it toucheth a Temporall cauÅ¿e, the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Å¿hall be Å¿till at the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Law. And the Å¿ame that I Å¿ay of Diffamations riÅ¿ing out of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall crimes, I hold alÅ¿o to be true in Diffamations Å¿pringing out of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:16473:128"/>
Temporall crimes, where puniÅ¿hment is required for the offence committed, and amends in money is not demaund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleÅ¿Å¿e happily that grow of penance injoyned, which the offender will redeeme by giving money to the Judge, or to the partie grieved. And this I take to be a farre better limitation for either Law, having the ground of the Civile Law, and a Statute of the Common Law, and common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on it Å¿elfe for it, than the other diviÅ¿e is, which Å¿o diÅ¿tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿heth this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, as Å¿till it makes it reÅ¿t in the mouth of the Judge, which cauÅ¿e of Diffamation is meere Å¿piritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and which not, which were not to be done if there were cleare dealing in the matter: for Lawes are Å¿o to be made, as that as little as may be, be left to the diÅ¿cretion of the Judge, but all be expreÅ¿Å¿ed as farre as the nature of the cauÅ¿e vvill give leave: vvhich albeit it be hard to doe, for the varietie of the caÅ¿es that every day happen, never thought on before, yet that is to be laboured Å¿o farre as may be; for this libertie of leaving many things to the Judges di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cretion, is many times great occaÅ¿ion of confuÅ¿ion in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, Å¿aying Å¿ometimes this, and Å¿ometimes that, as his private humor Å¿hall lead him: and therefore a plaine diÅ¿tinction betweene both the Lawes vvere beÅ¿t, that every man may Å¿ee, and Å¿ay vvhat is proper to either of them.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, it repelleth him that is a BaÅ¿tard, from all Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿sion, deÅ¿cending from the Father or the Mother, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in Goods or Lands, unleÅ¿Å¿e there bee Å¿ome other collaterall proviÅ¿ion made for the Å¿ame: for that all Å¿uch Lawes and Statutes as are made to any of theÅ¿e purpoÅ¿es, were intended to the benefit of Å¿uch as are legitimate, and are next of kin by lawfull Å¿ucceÅ¿sion, and not by unlawfull conjunction.</p>

                     <p>In this Realme, none of the foreÅ¿aid legitimations take place, as farre as I can learne, but onely that which is done by Parliament, and that very rarely; for beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e that King <hi>Henry</hi> the eigth did in the variety and mutability of <note place="margin">28. 8. cap. 7.</note> his minde, towards his owne iÅ¿Å¿ue, I thinke there cannot be many examples Å¿hewed: for, as for that which is wrought <note place="margin">1.

All theÅ¿e caÅ¿es of BaÅ¿tardie in other Lands, whether they be Å¿uch, or not Å¿uch, are tria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Law: But here with us it is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tionable, to what Law, and how farre they doe appertaine, whether to the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall or Temporall.</p>
                     <p>For the matter of BaÅ¿tardie, what it is, the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Law, and the Temporall differ not; but there is a diverÅ¿itie betweene them in the proÅ¿ecution thereof, for the EccleÅ¿ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticall Law bringeth it two wayes in Judgement; the one incidently, the other principally; but the Common Law ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth two Å¿orts thereof, the one generall, the other Å¿peciall: But firÅ¿t of the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall diviÅ¿ion, then of the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.

BaÅ¿tardie is then Å¿aid to be incidently propounded, when it is laid in barre of Å¿ome other thing, that is principally commenced; as when one Å¿ueth for an inheritance that he pretendeth is due unto him by his nativitie, an other croÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth him therein, by objecting againÅ¿t him baÅ¿tardie, with purpoÅ¿e to exclude him from his action in the inheritance: here the barre is in the incident, becauÅ¿e it comes excluÅ¿ive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the action of inheritance, but the action for the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it Å¿elfe was in the principall, for that it was begun in conÅ¿ideration of the inheritance, and not with intent to prove himÅ¿elfe legitimate; which happily hee never dreamed of, when he firÅ¿t entered his action for the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. In which caÅ¿e, he which is charged with the baÅ¿tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, may require himÅ¿elfe to be admitted to prove himÅ¿elfe legitimate, before the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Judge, and to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to be Å¿uch a one. <hi>Ad Curiam enim Regiamnon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet</hi>

                     <p>Speciall BaÅ¿tardy they Å¿ay is that, where the Matrimony <note place="margin">Bracton.</note> is confeÅ¿Å¿ed, but the priority or poÅ¿terioritie of the Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of him whoÅ¿e birth is in queÅ¿tion, is controverÅ¿ed; which to my thinking, if I conceive aright, is no other thing than the generall baÅ¿tardie, tranÅ¿ported in words, but agreeing in Å¿ubÅ¿tance &amp; matter with the other: for even theÅ¿e things which they pretend make Å¿peciall BaÅ¿tardie, are parts and members of the generall BaÅ¿tardie, and are either confeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed or inquired upon by vertue of the Kings writ in the Å¿ame: For firÅ¿t for the Matrimonie that is here mentioned, it is there agniÅ¿ed both by the Plaintife in pleading of it, and the Defendant in the anÅ¿wering thereto, and therefore the Plaintifes plea is thus; Thou art a BaÅ¿tard, for that thou waÅ¿t borne before thy parents were lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted together in Marriage, or before their Marriage was Å¿olemnized in the face of the Church: To which the Defendants reply is, I am no BaÅ¿tard, for that I was borne in lawfull Matrimony, or that I was borne after that my Father and Mother were lawfully married together: In both which you Å¿ee, there is a Marriage confeÅ¿Å¿ed, and the queÅ¿tion onely is of the priority or poÅ¿teriority of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of him that is charged withall, whether it happened before, or after his parents marriage, which, as they hold, is the other member of Å¿peciall BaÅ¿tardie: and yet this
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:16473:132"/>
prioritie or poÅ¿terioritie of nativity, by vertue of the Kings writ, comes no leÅ¿Å¿e in inquirie to the Ordinarie in the caÅ¿e of the generall BaÅ¿tardie, than they make it to be traverÅ¿able in the Å¿peciall BaÅ¿tardie; and therefore the writ to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary for generall BaÅ¿tardie, is conceived in this manner: <hi>viz.

not onely proper to theÅ¿e three Statutes, but alÅ¿o common to all other Statutes which are writ of any EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall cauÅ¿es within this Land; which notwithÅ¿tanding may be remedied, if it Å¿eeme good unto his Å¿acred MajeÅ¿tie and the reÅ¿t of the wiÅ¿edome of the land aÅ¿Å¿embled together at any time for the making of wholÅ¿ome Lawes, and the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Å¿ame, by Å¿upply of a few words in Å¿ome places, or periods that are defective, and yet keeping the true meaning and Å¿enÅ¿e of the Å¿ame.</p>
                     <p>As for example in the Statute of the two and thirtieth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, in the Â§ wherefore, neere the beginning of the Å¿ame Statute, the Statute ordering, that all perÅ¿ons of this Realme, and other of the Kings Dominions Å¿hall truly, and effectually Å¿et out, and pay all and Å¿ingular Tythes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lawfull cuÅ¿tomes, and uÅ¿ages of the PariÅ¿hes where they grow, and become due: becauÅ¿e there is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tion made where theÅ¿e cuÅ¿tomes and uÅ¿ages Å¿hall be tryed, in the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall or Temporall Law; if theÅ¿e or the like words had beene added to the Å¿ame (to be proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Judge after the forme of the EccleÅ¿ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticall Law, and not elÅ¿ewhere) the whole matter had beene cleare for that point.</p>
                     <p>And whereas againe in the end of the Å¿ame Statute, there be Å¿ome good words tending to the appropriating of theÅ¿e matters of Tythes, and obligations, and other EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall duties to the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Court: and that the remedie for them Å¿hall be had in the Spirituall Court according to the ordinance of the firÅ¿t part of that Act, and not otherwiÅ¿e: yet becauÅ¿e there is no penaltie to that act, buÅ¿ie men eaÅ¿ilie make a breach thereinto, for that Lawes without penalties, for the moÅ¿t part are weake &amp; of no force: if therefore this or the like Å¿upply were made (if any man Å¿ue for theÅ¿e, or like duties in any other Court, than in the Kings EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call court, the parties Å¿o Å¿uing, to forfeit the treble value of that which he Å¿ued for, to be recovered in the Kings Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Court, where it ought to have bin commenced, by the way of Libells, or Articles, the one halfe thereof Å¿hall

And yet there is no remedie for this in Law, Å¿o farre as I know, for that all theÅ¿e ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king but one perÅ¿on in Law, the Law yeelds no action to the one to Å¿ue the other: but yet the ancient practiÅ¿e of the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Law hath remedie, which would redreÅ¿Å¿e all this miÅ¿chiefe, if it were called again to uÅ¿e, &amp; might goe without controlme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, as the equity of the cauÅ¿e doth require. And the remedie is this, that Å¿uch other of the Executors
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:16473:142"/>
or AdminiÅ¿trators as are in this Å¿ort interverted from the execution of the Will, or AdminiÅ¿tration by the Å¿ubtiltie of any like Executor or AdminiÅ¿trator, Å¿hould crave the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of the Judge, and will him by vertue of his office, to call in Å¿uch practique Executor or AdminiÅ¿trator, and to command him under paine of excommunication, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further in the Å¿ole execution thereof, but commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate all his acts, and dealings with the reÅ¿t of his Coexe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors or CoadminiÅ¿trators: which if it were Å¿o ordered, would make many mens Wills and AdminiÅ¿trations bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter performed than they are, and a great Å¿ort of poore Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans Å¿tates more Å¿ure and certaine, than commonly they are in Å¿uch Executors or AdminiÅ¿trators hands.</p>
                     <p>And certainly in this caÅ¿e, there is Å¿ome good uÅ¿e of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ors in dead mens Wils (whom many men meerly jeÅ¿tar, calling them candle-holders, as though they could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elÅ¿e in the execution therof, but hold the candle while the Executors tell the Defuncts mony) if they might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to put in practiÅ¿e that authoritie which the Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them, and that is when they finde any Executor deale fraudulently in the execution of any TeÅ¿tators Will, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are named Å¿uperviÅ¿ors, or do ingroÅ¿Å¿e all the Å¿tate of the Defunct into his hands, as hath beene before Å¿aid, they call him to a particular account, that it may be Å¿eene how the adminiÅ¿tration Å¿tands, and each Executor may commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to other particular receipts and disburÅ¿ements: which if any Å¿hall refuÅ¿e to do, then may the SuperviÅ¿or make thereof complaint unto the Judge, as though the Å¿ame man dealt not truly in the execution thereof, who though perhaps in the beginning could not take bond of him, for <note place="margin">ff De admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tratione tuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. l. 3.

                  <p>Albeit that which hath beene already Å¿aid as concerning the Civile and EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Law may well imply the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿arie preÅ¿ervation of them both within this Land, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it was a thing I promiÅ¿ed to Å¿hew in the beginning of this TreatiÅ¿e, after that I had gone over the reÅ¿t of the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:16473:143"/>
parts of my diviÅ¿ion, I will in a word or two make plaine the neceÅ¿Å¿itie thereof.</p>
                  <p>And therefore for a ground of all the reÅ¿t, I will aÅ¿Å¿ume this for a matter confeÅ¿Å¿ed, that every man knowes, that every well ordered Common-wealth Å¿tands on two parts principally, the politick part, which conÅ¿iÅ¿teth of the Prince and people, and the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall part which Å¿tandeth in <hi>Sacris &amp; Sacerdotibus.</hi> And therefore well Å¿aid the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, Two of the greateÅ¿t things that God ever gave unto <note place="margin">In authent. quon. oport. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piÅ¿copod in prin. col. 1. Auth. de non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienand. &amp;c. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but Eccl. c. 2. Â§. 1.</note> the world (meaning earthly things) was the Empire or Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular government whereby the outward man is ordered and made, as <hi>AriÅ¿totle</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>bonus civis,</hi> that is, a good and loyall Å¿ubject: and the PrieÅ¿thood whereby the inward man is ruled, and is made, as the Å¿aid Author teÅ¿tifieth, <hi>bonus vir,</hi> that is, a good and vertuous man, which are two won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull effects of the whole government in generall; neither can the one of theÅ¿e be wanting, but the other will be ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and brought to deÅ¿olation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, no man is ignorant of this, but in politique government two things Å¿way the whole Å¿tate, the one is peace at home, and the other is warre abroad: which as they have their Å¿eaÅ¿ons, Å¿o they have their cauÅ¿es and effects, the one from counÅ¿ell at home, the other from diÅ¿cipline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; neither can the one, or the other of theÅ¿e be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but by their private and proper Lawes.</p>
                  <p>BeÅ¿ide, in peace who Å¿eeth not, there is as much need of vent by Å¿ea, for to benefit the Common-wealth by, either by importation of thoÅ¿e things that wee want at home, or by exportation of thoÅ¿e things wee abound with; as there is proviÅ¿ion to be made for the increaÅ¿ing and preÅ¿erving of thoÅ¿e things that wee have riÅ¿ing and growing by land in our owne countrie, neither of which can be had or injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without their proper Lawes fit and appertaining to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther policie? And what Law is there that ordereth theÅ¿e buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿es but the Civile Law onely, which giveth a forme to Navigation, and all occurrents that happen by Å¿ea, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be in, or about the Navigation it Å¿elfe or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contracts,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:16473:143"/>
or as it were contracts that are made in, upon, or beyond the Å¿ame.</p>
                  <p>As a Legall forme is requiÅ¿ite in peace at home, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine affaires abroad, that every thing may have his due ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect according to the right thereof, Å¿o alÅ¿o it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary in warlike exploits upon the Sea, that every action have his limits and bounds, whereby JuÅ¿tice may bee miniÅ¿tred: which if it be to be obÅ¿erved where lawfull warre is held betweene Prince and Prince, that every one be not left unto his owne luÅ¿t, much more is it expedient to be put in ure in Piracies and other Sea-robberies, where the innocent is Å¿poyled, and the Å¿poiler is enriched. The redreÅ¿Å¿e whereof is not, but by the Admirall Law, to whom the Princes of this Land have granted that authoritie.</p>
                  <p>For the often commerce of Princes with Princes, &amp; the negotiation that one State hath with an other, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more neceÅ¿Å¿ary, than frequent EmbaÅ¿Å¿ages, wereby intelligence may be had what danger one State intendeth to an other, &amp; how the Å¿ame may be prevented by Leagues or otherwiÅ¿e, and how the Å¿ame may be made and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: I know not what Law Å¿erves better for all theÅ¿e ends and purpoÅ¿es than the Civile Law.</p>
                  <p>In matters that appertaine to the Å¿oules health, the Preacher teacheth out of the word of God, wherein the right Å¿ervice of God Å¿tandeth, hee miniÅ¿treth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto the people, and inÅ¿tructeth them in other fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall points of Religion. but it is the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Law that compelleth men to the due obÅ¿ervance hereof, and puniÅ¿heth the trangreÅ¿Å¿ors.</p>
                  <p>All men grant, that there is a proviÅ¿ion to be made for the MiniÅ¿ter, for that it is againÅ¿t reaÅ¿on that any man Å¿hould goe to warfare on his charges: but it is the Law of the Church that Å¿ets out this proviÅ¿ion, and yeeldeth remedie for the recoverie thereof, if it be denied.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is more due unto the dead, than that their laÅ¿t Wils Å¿hould be obÅ¿erved; for that it is Å¿uch an ordinance as a man hath not in his power againe, when God hath once called him hence, neither is there any thing that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:16473:144"/>
have more gratiouÅ¿ly granted unto their Å¿ubjects, than that in their life-time they may diÅ¿poÅ¿e of that which after they are dead, is none of theirs; and yet Å¿hall take place when they are not, as though yet they were theirs: in which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ion the Civile and the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Law, are above all other Lawes moÅ¿t religious.</p>
                  <p>ChriÅ¿tening, Wedding, Burying, whereby a man entreth into this world, converÅ¿eth in the world, and returneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine unto the earth, from whence he was taken, and Å¿o af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paÅ¿Å¿eth to glorie, and everlaÅ¿ting bliÅ¿Å¿e, are every one of the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall cogniÅ¿ance.</p>
                  <p>How many men of great skill, Å¿uch as few Princes have greater in all kinde of learning, are of this ranke, not only in the Å¿ocietie of them that profeÅ¿Å¿e this knowledge here in the chiefeÅ¿t Citie of the Land, but alÅ¿o in both the UniverÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and in Å¿undry other places of this Realme, not Å¿trangers, or forrainers, but home-borne Å¿ubjects, of the Å¿ame faith, of the Å¿ame religion, of the Å¿ame kindred, and familie, of like alleagiance to the Prince, and Å¿ervice to the Commonwealth as other his good Å¿ubjects are, even thoÅ¿e that oppugne this profeÅ¿Å¿ion chiefly; whoÅ¿e practice, if it be overthrowne, or proviÅ¿ion leÅ¿Å¿ened, not onely thoÅ¿e that are now preÅ¿ent, &amp; make profeÅ¿Å¿ion of this knowledge Å¿hall be faine to turne their copie, but thoÅ¿e that are futurely to come, will change their profeÅ¿Å¿ion, when they Å¿ee there is no reward or eÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation belonging thereto? for it is honour that nouriÅ¿heth Arts, and no man will follow that profeÅ¿Å¿ion that is out of count, and credit; but every Father will Å¿ay unto his Son in like Å¿ort as <hi>Ovids</hi> Father Å¿aid to him, when hee Å¿aw him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and give himÅ¿elfe wholy to Poetrie, <hi>Studium quid inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile tent as?</hi> It was anciently Å¿aid of the profeÅ¿Å¿ion of theÅ¿e Lawes, <hi>Dat JuÅ¿tinianus honores;</hi> but now it is Å¿o far off from that, that it conferres honours, as that it is almoÅ¿t a diÅ¿cre. dit for any man to be a Civilian in this State, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion thereof doth Å¿carce keepe beggerie from the gate.</p>

Who though he be a man, for the moÅ¿t part, choÅ¿en by the Prince himÅ¿elfe, out of the reÅ¿t of the Sages of this Land, for his Å¿peciall good parts of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and integritie above the reÅ¿t (as now the honourable perÅ¿on is that occupieth that place, who is, as <hi>Tullie</hi> Å¿aid of that eloquent Orator <hi>Marcus CraÅ¿Å¿us, Non unus ex multis, Å¿ed unus inter omnes propÃ¨ Å¿ingularis)</hi> Å¿o that they might be thought for their great and eminent wiÅ¿dome in all things appertaining to their place, able to direct themÅ¿elves; yet becauÅ¿e it is, <hi>Divinitatis potiÃ¹s qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> humanitatis, omniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> reru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> habere memoriam, &amp; in nullo errare,</hi> as one Å¿aith, It was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently done by Princes of former age, to joyne to theÅ¿e great perÅ¿onages, men furniÅ¿hed with knowledge in theÅ¿e caÅ¿es of conÅ¿cience; wherin if they Å¿hould at any time Å¿tick, they might be adviÅ¿ed by them that are aÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ors with them, what they find in the law proportionable to the caÅ¿e in hand, that thereto they might Å¿quare their decree, or order accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; whoÅ¿e variety in theÅ¿e caÅ¿es is Å¿uch, that hardly there can fall out any caÅ¿e in practice, but there will be Å¿ome Law,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:16473:145"/>
in that learning, conformable unto it: which opportunity of men furniÅ¿hed with this knowledge for that Å¿eat, his MajeÅ¿ty Å¿hall want, unleÅ¿Å¿e the Å¿tudy of the Civill &amp; EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Law be maintain'd, which alÅ¿o for the caÅ¿es of equity &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tience therin, is cald of the old writers, <hi>Aequitas Canonica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what reaÅ¿on gave occaÅ¿ion to theÅ¿e precedent Princes to place men indowed with the skill of the Civill Law, in the Court of Chancerie, the Å¿ame alÅ¿o miniÅ¿tred unto them mindes to commit unto the Å¿elfe Å¿ame men, the ordering of their Courts of RequeÅ¿ts: for that therein, for the moÅ¿t part are handled poore miÅ¿erable perÅ¿ons cauÅ¿es, as widows and Orphans, and other diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed people, whoÅ¿e caÅ¿es wholy relie on pietie and conÅ¿cience, as a fit Å¿ubject for that Law to deale in, which alÅ¿o will take a maime, if the Å¿tudie of the Civill Law be not upholden.</p>
                  <p>So then to deny a free courÅ¿e to the Civill and EccleÅ¿ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticall Law in this Land, in Å¿uch things as appertaine to their profeÅ¿Å¿ion, or to abbridge the maintenance thereof, is to Å¿poyle his MajeÅ¿tie of a part of his honour (whoÅ¿e glory it is to be furniÅ¿hed with all Å¿orts of profeÅ¿Å¿ions neceÅ¿Å¿ary for his Å¿tate, and beneficiall for his Å¿ubject) to weaken the State publique, &amp; bereave it of grave and Å¿age men, to adviÅ¿e the State in matters of doubt and controverÅ¿ie betweene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Nations and themÅ¿elves, to diÅ¿arme the Church of her faithfull friends &amp; followers, and Å¿o to cut the Å¿inewes (as much as in them lyeth) of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall diÅ¿cipline, and to expoÅ¿e her to the teeth of thoÅ¿e, who for theÅ¿e many yeares have Å¿ought to devoure her up; and Å¿o now would do it, if the mercifull providence of God, and the gracious eye of the Prince did not watch over her.</p>
                  <p>And Å¿o far of the neceÅ¿Å¿itie of theÅ¿e two profeÅ¿Å¿ions, and generally of the uÅ¿e and diÅ¿uÅ¿e of the Civill and EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Law in this Land, and wherein it is overlaid by the Common-Law, and how it may be relieved, if it Å¿eeme good unto his MajeÅ¿tie, and the wiÅ¿edome of this Realme. All which I have written, not of any purpoÅ¿e to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the credit of that Law, under which I was borne, and by which I hold that Å¿mall maintenance that I have: (fo,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:16473:145"/>
I reverence it as a neceÅ¿Å¿ary Law for this State, and make Å¿uch reckoning of every of the profeÅ¿Å¿ours in his place, as becommeth me) but that it pitieth mee, and not only mee, but all thoÅ¿e that tender good learning, and have no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate minde toward the Common-Law, to Å¿ee two Å¿uch Noble Sciences as the Civill and EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Law are, Å¿o to be diÅ¿graced, as that there is no more reckoning made of them, or their profeÅ¿Å¿ours, than if they were matters and men of no worth, and fit or apt for no Å¿ervice in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: and yet notwithÅ¿tanding, the uÅ¿e of them is Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿arie as that the Common-wealth cannot want the Å¿ervice of them in matter of great importance to the State, which (if the profeÅ¿Å¿ion Å¿hould come to a downefall, as it is like Å¿hortly to do, if it be no more cheriÅ¿hed and made of than it is) will be Å¿ooner Å¿eene by the want of them, than is now perceived by the having of them; and then perhaps, will the State lament for the loÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿o goodly a profeÅ¿Å¿ion, when it will be hardly recovered againe, as the children of <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> did for the tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> when they had in one dey Å¿laine well nigh the whole number of them.</p>
