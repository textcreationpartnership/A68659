            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Learned and uſefull View of both the Lawes, once more adventureth it ſelfe upon the Opinion of Men, and it may now hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a more indifferent cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure then before, as being committed to a ſeaſon more mature, and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly diſpos'd; for howſoever the Time that firſt brought this forth, could not be charged with any notable diſtemper; yet the Common-wealth wee live in is of that thriving nature, that however the preſent time may ſtill bee good, yet it alwayes makes the ſucceeding Age better then it ſelfe. This argues the State not neare her ruine, though ſome unruly Spirits, led by an irregular Motion, have beene bold to anticipate; as if every one that bad ſo much pitty as to feare, had alſo judgement
<pb facs="tcp:16473:3"/>
enough to foreſee the ruine of a Kingdome. 'Twas more then enough for ſuch Men to ſet downe the Fate of a ſingle-ſoule, without reſolving upon the doome of a whole Nation. But theſe that would ſeeme to know ſuch high things, are moſt properly puniſhed by being neglected: for to a Man that would bee thought to know, and knoweth not, no greater miſerie can happen, then that hee ſhould faile of his Expectation. If I were to ſerve or follow any time, I would propoſe the Preſent, which as it hath leſſe of the pretences of former Ages, ſo it hath much more of the Moderation: and if it needs muſt be ſuſpected that the State is not farre from her fall, let this be the onely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe ſhe draweth ſo neere to her perfection. That which heretofore moſt of all incumbred theſe Dominions, was the diſproportion of the Civill Power to the Eccleſiaſticall. This a Great Prince abated, and the Act was truly maſculine, yet like thoſe of the ſtrongeſt importance, would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the ſame hand; therefore it was by him ſo fully done, on the one ſide, that it might be feared leſt it ſhould runne over on the other. To prevent this, the diſcretion of theſe late diſcerning times hath warily provided; the wiſedome of the Prince
<pb facs="tcp:16473:3"/>
having ſo well tempered both the Powers, that it may now be hoped, they ſhall agree one with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as both doe in him, by a glorious correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The State thus bending towards the beſt, and thé moſt perfect mediocrity, this Author whoſe hope that alwayes was, couldnot but revive again; therefore it is, that though hee be dead, hee yet ſpeaketh. If ſtill there be that will reprehend theſe our paines, as if they were caſt upon a man too much ſought after, be it ſo; but theſe men have leaſt cauſe to complaine, for if the matter of this Booke be, as they ſuppoſe, then the onely way to ſuppreſſe it will be to make it common, for things of that nature are leaſt of all enquired for, when they are moſt eaſily to be found; but if they rarely appeare, they are more eagerly ſought after, and the more obſtinately eſteem'd.</p>
            <p>VVhen first I would ſee this Treatiſe, I beheld it at a distance, and not without ſome prejudice; for ſo I was prompted by the inſinuations of a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Report; but finding it under the Protection of the High and Mighty Prince <hi>Iames,</hi> I tooke libertie to reſolve against all popular contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And now, to ſeeke any other Patron for this new Edition, I have thought it altogether inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
<pb facs="tcp:16473:4"/>
               <hi>For what can the man doe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth after the King?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For a Note or two, which I have here and there timerouſly let fall, If the Reader expect that I ſhould aske his pardon; there may bee cauſe, but there is no convenience: for this kinde of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is now adayes indifferently ſet before thoſe things that are well, and thoſe that are ill done. Beſides, it would argue Certaine follie, to be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged there for pardon, where our choyce is to offend. VVhat I have here done amiſſe, I ſhall hereafter hope to rectifie, either by doing ſomething that ſhall be better (if that may be) or (which is the ſafeſt way) by doing ſo no more.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST gratious Soveraigne, ſince it hath pleaſed Your Majeſtie of Your Princely care towards the Church, and Your Common-wealth, to take knowledge of ſome differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are in Iudicature betweene Your Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall and Civile Law, and the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law of this Land (by which joyntly Your Majeſties State is managed next after Your owne moſt rare providence, and the wiſdome of ſuch, whom it hath pleaſed Your Highneſſe to aſſociate unto Your ſelfe in the great affaires of Your Kingdome) I have been bold to offer unto Your Majeſtie this ſimple Treatiſe, as that which doth lay out the cauſe of thoſe Differences, more particularly than
<pb facs="tcp:16473:5"/>
any man hitherto hath expreſſed the ſame. In comming to which (becauſe I doe ſpeake for thoſe parts of Your Majeſties Lawes, which are leſſe knowne unto Your people, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed no otherwiſe of them, than they ſee the practice thereof to bee here within Your Land) I have thought good, as it were in a Briefe, to ſet out the whole ſumme of both the Lawes, to the view of the people, that they may ſee, there is more worth in thoſe for whom I ſpeake, than was by many conceived to bee: So that the profeſsion of the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall and Civile Law may appeare to the world, neither to bee idle nor unfit for the State; ſo farre as it hath pleaſed the Royall Predeceſſours of Your Highneſſe to give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment unto it, and Your Majeſtie Your ſelfe to admit of it. In all which there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing ſought, than that ſuch greevances as have beene of late offered by one Iuriſdiction unto the other, and in conſequence, to all Your Subjects, who follow any ſuits in the Civile or Eccleſiaſticall Courts, may by Your Princely wiſdome be conſidered, and by Your authoritie be redreſſed, if they be found to be
<pb facs="tcp:16473:5"/>
greevances indeed: for now as things are, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iuriſdiction knowes their owne bounds, but one ſnatcheth from the other, in maner, as in a batable ground lying betweene two Kingdomes; but ſo, that the weaker ever go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the worſe, and that which is mightier prevailes againſt the other: the profeſſors thereof being rather willing to give Lawes and interpretations to other, than to take or admit of any againſt themſelves. For which, the weaker appeales unto your Highneſſe, humbly deſiring Your Majeſties upright and ſincere Iudgement to diſcerne where the wrong is, and to redreſſe it accordingly, which is a worke worthy Your Majeſties high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. For as the Land is Yours, ſo alſo the Sea is Yours, and the Church is under Your Highneſſe protection, as a Childe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Tutor; ſo that all the Lawes thereof appertaine unto Your Majeſties care &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort alike: For which, not onely the whole profeſsion of Your Eccleſiaſticall and Civile Lawyers that now are, but thoſe which ſhall ſucceed in thoſe places for ever hereafter unto the worlds end, will praiſe and magnifie

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, I confeſſe, as I meditated this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe upon mine owne motion (as I doe ſomtimes matters of other argument, when my leaſure ſerves mee thereto) ſo alſo I doe not ſet it out to the view of the world upon mine owne motion, but was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous it ſhould have beene kept in, ſaving that I muſt obey where I am bound. The thing that gave mee cauſe to this meditation, was, that I ſaw many times how meanly men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of the Civile and Eccleſiaſticall Law of this Land, valuing them by the practice of ſo much of them, as we have among us. And therefore I thought good, although not wholly to unfold the riches of them, yet to make ſhew of them folded up, in ſuch ſort as Mercers make ſhew of their ſilkes and velvets, laid up in whole peeces in their ſhops; whereby it may bee ſeene, what great variety they have of all theſe kinde of wares, although the goodneſſe of the ware it ſelfe cannot be diſcerned, becauſe it is foulded up: Beſides, ſeeing how frequent prohibitions are in theſe dayes in cauſes of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cogniſance more than have beene in former time, I thought it not unworthy my labour to inquire and ſee upon what juſt grounds they are raiſed up in this multitude; not of any humour I have, to gaineſay the lawfull proceedings of any Court (which I reverence and moſt readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their authoritie in all things belonging to their place) but to know and ſearch out the truth of thoſe ſuggeſtions that give cauſe unto theſe prohibitions. For whenas ſuch Lawes as are written of theſe buſineſſes, are written indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, as well for the one Iuriſdiction as the other, no man is to be offended if the one Iuriſdiction, finding it ſelfe preſ
<pb facs="tcp:16473:7"/>
ſed by the partiall interpretation (as it ſuppoſeth) of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inquire the ground of ſuch interpretation, and labour to redreſſe it if it may be, by the right interpretation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: To the end, that either Iuriſdiction may retaine their owne right, and not the one bee overtopt by the other, as it ſeemeth to be at this day: And that in ſuch matters (as they concerne) of their owne right, as depend of no other autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie but of the Prince alone: which is the thing onely that is ſought in this little Treatiſe. And therefore the Reverend Iudges of this Land are to be intreated, that they will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe an equall interpretation of theſe matters, as well to the one Iuriſdiction as the other, for ſo it is comely for them to doe; and if they doe it not, the other are not ſo dull-ſenced, but they can perceive it, nor ſo daunted, but that they can flie for ſuccour unto him, to whoſe high place and wiſdome, the deciding of theſe differences doth of right appertaine. <hi>PENELOPE</hi> is ſaid to have had many wooers comely in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and eloquent in ſpeech, but ſhee reſpected none but her owne <hi>ULYSSES:</hi> Such ſhould be the minde of a Iudge, that whatſoever other appearance or ſhew of truth be offered, one ſaying, This is the true ſence of the Law, and an other that; yet the Iudge ſhould reſpect none but the very true germane and genuine ſence thereof indeed. Which if it were religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly or indifferently obſerved in every Court, then needed not this complaint that now is, but every Iuriſdiction ſhould peaceably hold his owne right, ſuch as the Prince, Law, or Cuſtome hath afforded unto it.</p>

But before I ſpeake of the Civile Law in particular, I will define what Right, or <note place="margin">What Law is.</note> Law is, in generall: Law therefore is (as <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> ſaith, <hi>L. 10. in fin. ff. de Juſticia &amp; Jure)</hi> the knowledge of Civile and humane things, the underſtanding of thoſe things which are juſt and unjuſt. This Law is primarily divided into the Law publick, and the Law private. The <note place="margin">1. Jus publicum.</note> publick, is that which appertaineth to the generall ſtate of the common-wealth, for I meane the Law publick, not in reſpect of the Forme, that they were publickly made, as we make lawes in our Parliaments (for ſo all the Civile Law is publick, as made by publick authority) but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the object, or end thereof, for that they concerne the Church, the Clergie, the Magiſtrate, and other like publick functions, none of which levell at the rule of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or equality between man and man, as private lawes doe, but ayme at that which is moſt fit, ingenerall, for the common State. <note place="margin">2. Jus privatum.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The private Law, or the private mens Law, is that which concernes every ſingular mans ſtate; which, for that it is occupied in giving every man his owne, it muſt of neceſſitie be proportionable to the rule of Equitie and Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Private Law is of three ſorts, the law of Nature, the law of Nations, and the law Civile.</p>
                     <p>The law of Nature, is that which Nature hath taught every living creature, as the care and defence of every <note place="margin">The Law of Nature.</note> creatures life, deſire of libertie, the conjunction of male and female for procreation ſake.</p>
                     <p>The law of Nations, is that which common reaſon hath eſtabliſhed among men, and is obſerved alike in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">The Law of Nations.</note> as diſtinctions of mens rights, buildings of houſes,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16473:8"/>
erecting of Cities, ſocietie of life, judgements of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, war, peace, captivity, contracts, obligations, ſucceſſion, and the like.</p>
                     <p>The law Civile, being largely taken, is the law that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular Nation frameth to it ſelfe, as the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3.

                     <p>And certainly, albeit ſundry other Nations by the light of Nature, have many Rules and Maximes in the Civile law: yet, if all the conſtitutions, cuſtomes, and lawes, of all other people and countries were put together (I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept none, ſave the lawes of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from God) they are not comparable to the law of the <hi>Romans,</hi> neither in wiſdome nor equitie, neither in gravitie nor in ſufficiency. Whereupon it is, that moſt of other Nations, (ſaving our owne) although they receive not the Civile law wholely for their law, yet they ſo much admire the equitie thereof, that they interpret their owne lawes thereby. <hi>Peckius de regul. juris.

Laſtly comes thoſe which have right thereto, either in that they are man or wife. The Law ſundry times, where a thing is done, or intended to be done, againſt an other mans right, &amp; there is no proviſion for it in Law, yeeldeth the party grieved an Interdict or Injunction to hinder that which was intended to his prejudice, As where one buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth an houſe contrary to the uſuall and received forme of building, to the injurie of his neighbour, there lyeth an Injunction <hi>de novi operis nunciatione,</hi> which being once ſerved, the offender is either to deſiſt from his worke, or to put in ſuerties, hee ſhall pull it downe again, if hee doe not within a very ſhort time avow the lawfulneſſe thereof.

of the debt not paid, as if it were paid. Of Obligations ſome are Civile, as thoſe which have beene heretofore handled, ſome Pretorian or pertaining to the Chancery, as thoſe whereby Tutors, Curators, and Proctors, enter into band unto a child, that his ſtate ſhall be ſafe, that is committed to their hands: That, that ſhall be paid which the Judge cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: That the Plaintife ſhall ratifie and allow that which his Proctor ſhall doe for him in judgement, and ſuch like. Criminall Judgements are private or publick, that is, they are commenced either upon private offences, or upon pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick faults and ſuits. Private offences concerne private mens revenge and injuries. Publick, the revenge or injurie of the whole ſtate. Private offences which had ordinary proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ordinary puniſhment, were many, among whcih <note place="margin">Private of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</note> Theft is the chiefeſt, which is a deceitfull fingering of an other mans goods, with intent to gain either the thing it ſelfe, or the uſe or poſſeſſion thereof; ſo that the mind alone maketh not theft, but the act joyned to the minde, be the quantity never ſo ſmall. Of Thefts, ſome are manifeſt, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not manifeſt; manifeſt is that, wherein the offender is taken in the deede doing, or taken before he could carrie away the thing ſtolne thither, whither he intended: the puniſhment whereof was foure double the value of that which was ſtolne: Not manifeſt, was that wherein the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty offending was not taken in the deede doing, and the pain thereof was the double of that which was purloyned, or taken away. If any pilfery or theft be done in a Ship, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, or Inne, the Maſter of the Ship, Taverne, or Inne, is to anſwer double the value thereof, if the ſame be done by himſelfe, or their ſelves, or any of their marriners or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: for it behoveth them to have honeſt men, whom they are to imploy in ſuch ſervices: But if it be done by any of the paſſengers, or gueſts of the houſe, the owners of the Ship, Taverne, or Iune, are not to anſwer for the ſame, for they cannot turne away ſuch gueſts as come into their houſe; neither, in all likelihood, know they the quality or condition of their gueſts. If any man privily, unwitting
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16473:16"/>
the owner thereof, cut downe, hack, or barke any tree of any ſort whatſoever, or thoſe that are of the nature of trees, as Ivie, Reedes, Willows, ſo that they be ſpoyled, hee is to anſwer the double value of that hee hath cut downe and ſpoyled: and further, if it be a Vine-tree, to be puniſhed as a robber. Hee that taketh any thing away from another by violence, is to be puniſhed in the worth foure fold, for that it is a ſin more grievous than theft: If any man upon any ill intent, make a Tumult, whereby any hurt commeth to any man, he ſhall anſer double of that the party is harmed in: If any, upon a burning of a houſe, or the fall thereof, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſhipwrack, or the ſpoyling of a boat or ſhip, ſteale any thing away, or being put in truſt to keepe any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, conceale the ſame, hee ſhall pay the foure double of the ſame; but if any man ſet the ſame afire himſelfe, he is either to be caſt out to wilde beaſts, or is to be burnt with the ſame fire he went about to burne an other with. If any have ſpitefully, contumeliouſly injured an other man, his wife, or children, in deede, word, or writing, they are to forfeit ſo much as the partie greeved ſhall eſteeme himſelfe injured by, or the Judge ſhall taxe it at. A famous Libell is where a <note place="margin">Libell what.</note> man hath of malitious purpoſe writ, compounded, or ſet out any thing to the infamie of an other, without a name, or with a name, and the puniſhment thereof is death, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently was that he loſt the power or liberty to make a Will; the like puniſhment followeth him, that having found an infamous Libell, doth not by and by ſpoyle the ſame, that the knowledge thereof come not abroad, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where the matter thereof is capitall or worthy death.</p>
                     <p>Extraordinary crimes, are thoſe which have no ordinary <note place="margin">Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Crimes.</note> puniſhment appointed them, but are arbitrarie at the Judges appointment, ſuch as are Sollicitors of other folkes wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockes, and Maids chaſtities, although they miſſe of their purpoſe; ſuch as of purpoſe caſt myre, durt, or any like filth upon another, to the intent to diſgrace him: ſuch as, being with childe, of purpoſe cauſe themſelves to miſcarry: Such as keepe brothell and baudy-houſes, or other unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16473:17"/>
company: Juglers, and ſuch as carry about Snakes, and other like Serpents and trumpery to put men in feare: Such as hide and ſuppreſſe Corne, to cauſe the price to be dearer: Such as either make, or uſe falſe weights wittingly; for all which, becauſe there is no proper puniſhment provided in the Law, they are referred to the puniſhment of the Judge, who is to puniſh them according to the quality of the fact, age, and underſtanding of the offender, and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances according as he ſhall thinke good; ſo, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he exceed not a convenient meaſure therein, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtretch the ſame to death but upon ſome great and weighty cauſe, he is to be content with meaner puniſhment, as temporall baniſhment, whipping, or ſome moderat pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary mulct. For violating or defacing another mans ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, Imfamy was impoſed, beſides a pecuniary mulct to be divided betweene the Prince and the party grieved, but if any dig up the corſe of the deceaſed, the puniſhment is death. If any, by feare of his office or authority, wring any money from any man, or exact more fees in any matter than he ought to doe, or cauſe him to marry, or doe any other thing he would not doe, the forfeiture is foure double the value of that which hath been taken, beſide further puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the diſcretion of the Judge. Such as drive mens cattell out of their ground, or ſever them from the flock or herd, with intent to ſteale them, if they doe it with a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon like unto a Robber, are condemned to be throwne to wild beaſts, otherwiſe are more lightly puniſhed according to the diſcretion of the Judge. Such as in Judgement take money on both ſides, or taking upon them the defence of one ſide, betray the cauſe, and take money on the other ſide, are infamous by law, and are puniſhed at the diſcretion of the Judge. Such as receive theeves, and other like malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, are puniſhed in like ſort as the theeves or malefactors themſelves are; eſpecially if they have aſſiſted them in their wickedneſſe: otherwiſe, if they onely knew it, &amp; received them, they are more mildly to be puniſhed, eſpecially if the offenders were their kinſmen: for, their offence is not like
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16473:17"/>
theirs, which entertain thoſe, which are no kin to them at all; when as it is naturall for every one to regard his owne blood: and fathers are many times more carefull for their children, than for themſelves; but if that hee that received them knew nothing of the offence, then is he altogether to be excuſed. Such as break priſon, are to be puniſhed by death, becauſe it is a certain treaſon to break the Princes ward, but if they ſcape by the negligence of the Keepers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom the preſumption lyeth ever in this caſe, they are more lightly to be puniſhed. If any commit Burglarie, breaking up a doore or wall, with intent to doe a Robbery, if they be baſe companions, they are to be condemned to the Mynes or Gallies; but if they be of better reckoning, they are to be put from the ranke or order wherein they are, or to be baniſhed for a ſeaſon. Juglers and like Impoſtors, which goe about deceiving of the people with falſe tricks and toyes, hookes and ſuch like, which inſinuate themſelves into other mens houſes, with purpoſe to ſteale, are puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the diſcretion of the Judge.</p>
                     <p>If any ſteale, or take away any thing out of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of another man, before either the Will be proved, or adminiſtration be taken; an action of theft lyeth not, becauſe the inheritance, during the time, was counted no bodies, but he is to be puniſhed by the diſcretion of the Judge; yea, though it were the heire himſelfe that did it. Coſenage, whereby a man craftily ſuppreſſeth ſome thing he ſhould not, or putteth one thing in anothers place, to the deceit of him that hee dealeth withall, or corrupteth ſuch wares which hee uttereth, or doth any other thing colluſorily, which is called of the Law <hi>Crimen Stellionatus,</hi> (of a little vermin or creature called <hi>Stellio,</hi> much like to a Liſard, moſt <note place="margin">Crimen Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionatus.</note> envious to man) is cenſured by ſome ignominious &amp; ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful puniſhment, or by diſgracing the perſon, by putting him out of the Office, Place, or Order he is in, or by injoyning him ſome ſervile worke, or by baniſhing him for a time, or by ſome like puniſhment, at the diſcretion of the Judge. If any plough up a Mere balke, or remove any other marke
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16473:18"/>
which hath accuſtomed to be a Marke or bound betweene ground and grounds, which anciently was counted reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and religious among men, the offence is puniſhed either by a pecuniarie mulct, or by baniſhment, or whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, at the diſcretion of the Judge. Unlawfull Colledges, Corporations, and aſſemblies, gathered together to bad uſes, as to eating, drinking, wantonneſſe, hereſie, conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie, are puniſhed as publick Routs or Riots, otherwiſe at the diſcretion of the Judge: All theſe, before recited, are called Popular Actions, becauſe, not onely he that is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but every other honeſt ſubject may purſue and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Publick Judgements are ſuch, which immediatly pertain <note place="margin">Publick Judgements.</note> to the puniſhment of the common-wealth for example ſake, and are examined, tried, and puniſhed by a publick or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der appointed by Law, the partie grieved, making himſelfe partie to the ſuite, and following the ſame; the party accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the meane while remaining in priſon, or putting in ſuerties for his appearance, and the partie grieved for the proſecuting of the ſame. The chiefeſt of which ſort is Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is a diminiſhing or derogation of the Majeſtie of the people, or Prince, on whom the people have colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all their power, which is puniſhed with death, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation of the Lands and goods of the offender, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall aboliſhment of his memorie. The next is Adultery, which is violating of an other mans bed, whoſe puniſhment anciently was death, both in the man and in the woman, but after it was mitigated in the woman, ſhee being firſt whipt, and then ſhut up in a Monaſterie: but by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, other paines are inflicted.

Appeales are made from lower Judges to higher, and from him that is Delegated, to him that did Delegate: Appeales are to be made within ten dayes after ſentence given, or within ten dayes after the Notice is come to the party againſt whom the Sentence did paſſe, unleſſe there attend thereon a continuall griefe, in which caſe, a man may appeale ſo long as the griefe indures: the time to aske Dimiſſorie Letters, is thirty daies from the Sentence given; the time to preſent the ſame to the Judge, is at the diſcretion of the Judge from whom; the time of proſecuting the ſame is a year, or, upon juſt cauſe, two years; in which time, if the ſute be not ended, the cauſe is deſerted, and to be ſent back unto the Judge, from whom the Appeale was firſt made: while the Appeale hangeth, nothing is to bee innovated, becauſe by the Appeale, the Judges hands are, as it were, bound: but if the former Sentence were voyde by law, (as in ſundry caſes they are) then there needeth no Appeale; for ſuch Sentences never paſſe into a caſe judged. Appeales in criminall caſes, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtified by a Proctor; but it is otherwiſe in Civile Cauſes.

                     <p>The Exchequer is the Princes Treaſurie, and the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the common-wealth, and hath many and ſingular prerogatives, which private men have not. Such as are taken captive by the enemy, become their ſervants, who have taken them, unleſſe either they eſcape home again themſelves, or be ranſomed by their friends; in both which caſes, they recover all right and priviledges they had in their owne common-wealth before. By the Law, all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects whatſoever, are bound to ſerve the common-wealth in warre; in ſo much that if any, being preſt, withdraw himſelfe, or his childe from it, he is to be counted as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, and for his puniſhment, is to be baniſhed, and mulcted or fined in the greateſt part of his goods. As the priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and rewards of Souldiers were many to encourage them to vertue and manhood; ſo their ſhames and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were great, to feare them from cowardice and vice: But among the reſt of the priviledges of Souldiers, the old Souldiers were the greateſt. Of Subjects, ſome dwelt in Shires, and lived after their owne Lawes, and yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe were made partakers of the honours of the Citie: ſome other were inhabitants onely in the common-wealth, and had onely a houſe in the ſame place to dwell in, and had no right to bear office: ſome other were ſtrangers brought in, which were ruled by the Law of them among whom they dwelt. Amongſt thoſe that dwelt in Shires, the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Magiſtrate was he whom they called <hi>Decurio,</hi> who was not ſent by the people of Rome thither (for he was a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of Magiſtrates) but elected by the people there; and his office was, to keepe the treaſurie of the Countrey to provide victuall, exact tribute, &amp; govern the ſtate there, in maner as our Sherifes doe here: His office was onely

                        <hi>annuall,</hi> leſt by liberty, and luſt of government, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance thereof it might grow into a tyrannie. Such as are Subjects, are to ſerve the common-wealth in ſuch offices, places, and ſervices, as their abilitie is fit for, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of the common-wealth requires. The ſervices of the common-wealth were of three ſorts; Patrimoniall, ſuch as belong to every mans patrimony to performe, which ſtood chiefly upon payment and charges, which were to goe out of every mans inheritance towards the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ſuch burthen as lay upon him by law, cuſtome, or command of him that had power thereto: Perſonall, which were to be performed by the care and induſtrie of the partie and his corporall labour, without expence of his purſe. Mixt, which required both care of the minde, and labour of the body, and expence of the purſe, and are impoſed as well in conſideration of the thing, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which every ſubject is to undergoe, unleſſe by the Law, or by the indulgence of the Prince they are excuſed; as ſome are excuſed by reaſon of old age, ſome by young age, ſome for their dignity, ſome for their calling, ſome for their ſtate of body, ſome for that they ſerve in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie ſervices of the common-wealth at home, or abroad, as Embaſſadours do, ſome for that they are in neceſſary pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſervices for Gods Religion, as cathedrall Churches, and other Churches are; ſome for that they are of good and neceſſary places for Seminaries for the common-wealth, for learning and ſuch othe imployments, as Colledges, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and Schooles of learning and nurture are. Legates and Embaſſadours had immunitie from all publick ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, not onely the time of their embaſſage, but alſo two years after their returne; They were called Legates, in that they were choſen as fit men, out of many; their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was ſacred both at home and abroad, ſo that no man might lay violent hands on them without breach of the Law of Nations. Such as are Magiſtrates of Cities ought ſo to governe, that no negligence may bee juſtly imputed unto them, otherwiſe they are to anſwer it, and that when
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16473:21"/>
their office is expired, they give up a juſt account, both of what they have received, and what they have layd out, and pay in the reſidue, if there bee any. Governours of Cities, together with the conſent of the Burgeſſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, may ſet downe ſuch orders and decrees, as are for the benefit and well ordering thereof, which are to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all thoſe which are Inhabitants thereof, and being once well and duely ſet downe, are not to be reverſed, but to the good of the Citie or Commonalty. New publick workes, ſuch as are good for the Common-weale, every one may make without the leave of the Prince, unleſſe it be done for aemulation, or cauſe of diſcord; but for old works, in which ſtands the ſecurity of the Common-wealth, as Caſtles, Towers, Gates, and Wals of Cities, nothing is to be done or innovated in them, without the Princes war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; neither is it lawfull for any man to grave his name in any publick Worke, unleſſe it be his, at whoſe coſt the worke is done. Faires are authorized by Princes onely, and are invented for trade of merchandize, and uttering of wares, which Country-men have cauſe to buy, or ſell: and have their priviledges, that no man in any Faire can be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted for any private debt; they were called <hi>Nundinae,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that among the <hi>Romans,</hi> they were anciently holden in one place or other upon every ninth day. Hee that for ten years ſpace intermitteth to uſe his Faire, loſeth the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof. If any make any promiſe to a Citie or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, to do any thing upon certain cauſe, as that hee might be made Conſul, or that he would repair ſome part of the Citie that was burnt, he ſhall, by the Law, be compelled to performe his promiſe; for it is not meet that ſuch promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhould be ſatisfied with repentance. Such as profeſſe libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sciences in any Common-wealth, whereby youth is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, &amp; brought up to knowledge, or be School-maſters, or Profeſſours of Phyſick, or be Midwives, Notaries, Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or Caſters of accounts, or Regiſters, the Law alloweth, not only a competent ſtipend in recompence of their skill &amp; paines, but alſo affords them means, how the ſame may be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16473:22"/>
recovered if it be denied. But as for Philoſophers and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, the Law hath appointed them no ſtipend, not becauſe they are not reverend Sciences, and worthy reward or ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, but becauſe either of them are moſt honourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, whoſe worthineſſe is not to be valued or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by money: yet in theſe caſes many things are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly taken, which are not honeſtly asked; and the Judge may according to the quality of the cauſe, and the skill of the Advocate, the cuſtome of the Court, and the worth of the matter that is in hand, appoint them a fee anſwerable to their place, as alſo to ſuch as are Interpreters betweene parties in matters of traffick, when one underſtands not an others language.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſecond Tome of the Law, is the Code, and ſtands in twelve Books, whereof eight, for the Titles, follow in a manner the order of the Digeſt, a few titles onely excepted, which are added, beſides thoſe of the Digeſt; but as for the foure other, which are the firſt, the tenth, the eleventh, and the twelfth; although the ſubject they treat of be named in the Digeſt; yet the things which are there named, are not handled in the Digeſt; and therefore will I paſſe over thoſe eight other, leſt happely I might ſeeme to doe one thing twice, and therefore will I referre the Reader over to that which hath beene ſaid of them before, in the handling of the Digeſt; for they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt twinnes of one mother; ſo that whoſoever knowes the one, ſhall with no great difficulty diſcerne the other,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16473:22"/>
and come to the other foure; yet not mentioned there: But yet before I lay open the matter thereof, I will in a word or two ſhew why this Volume of the Law is called the Code, who is the author thereof, and out of whom it was collected, what moved the author, after ſo many learned titles ſet downe before, of ſuch things as are in the Digeſt deduced, by ſuch a number of worthy Lawyers (as the Lawes of the Digeſt themſelves doe by their inſcriptions ſhew; for every law, carrieth with him in his forehead, the name of his Author) to make a new flouriſh of the ſame, and what the knowledge of the Code doth conferre unto a Student or practiſer of the Law, more than the knowledge of the Digeſt doth.</p>
                     <p>The Code therefore is named of the word <hi>Caudex,</hi> that is, the trunke or timber of the tree, from which the barke of the tree is pill'd or pull'd off, of which men anciently uſed to make writing-tables, artificially binding them up into the forme of a booke, and uſing them for bookes, before the uſe of paper or parchment was knowne; inſomuch, as many of theſe tables being bound together, they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Code, or booke: beſides, whereas the ancient Lawyers <note place="margin">Why this Tome of the Law is called the Code.</note> before <hi>Juſtinians</hi> time, uſed to write their pleas and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in ſcroules of paper or parchment, <hi>Juſtinian</hi> himſelfe firſt put them in a booke, and therefore termed them by the name of a Code.</p>
                     <p>The Code it ſelfe is compiled of the anſwers of 56. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, and their wiſe Councell, whereof ſundry were <note place="margin">What the Code is.</note> learned and skilfull Lawyers, as the ſtorie of that time doth ſhew, and the lawes themſelues doe name ſome of them, as that moſt excellent and famous man <hi>Papinian,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that is, from the dayes of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour, unto the age of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe that moved <hi>Juſtinian</hi> hereto, was, that in the <note place="margin">The reaſon which moved the Emperour to compile the Code.</note> Digeſt hee found not every caſe decided, that fals out in common uſe of life (for how is it poſſible, when as every moment there fals out new matter, for which former lawes made no proviſion?) and therefore thought good to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16473:23"/>
that by new Lawes, which he found defective in the old: ſo that the multiplication of thoſe titles grew not, that the Emperour had any meaning, to fill the world with multitude of Lawes, for hee had found the inconvenience thereof already, and therefore had repealed and aboliſhed ſo many thouſand of old Lawes, as he had; but it came ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that, that the multitude of cauſes were ſo many, that every day there fell out ſome unexpected thing that was never heard of before: beſide notwithſtanding the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the Emperour himſelfe, and his great Lawyer <hi>Tribonian,</hi> and others, whom he uſed for the ſelecting and chooſing out of the pureſt, beſt, and moſt agreeing Lawes among themſelves, out of that indigeſted heap of Lawes he then aboliſhed; yet they were not ſo quick ſighted, but in that great worke, ſundry <hi>antinomies</hi> or contrary Lawes paſt them, which had need to be expounded and amended, and the Authors to be recited. Further, ſundry of ancient Lawes were ſo ſubtilely written, that there was more wit than profit in them; ſo that it was expedient, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſhould explain the ſame, &amp; putting all ſubtility aſide, give a right ſence unto the Law. Laſtly, whereas many things were delivered by them briefly, and therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, the Law-giver in his Princely wiſdome, ſet out the ſame in other Lawes more plentifully and diſtinctly, all which were the chiefeſt cauſes, why the Emperour ſet out the booke of the Code.</p>
                     <p>The Code neither in ſtyle, nor in methode cometh to <note place="margin">The difference betweene the Digeſt and the Code.</note> the perfection of the Digeſt, as that which for the ſtyle is a barbarous Thracian phraſe Latinized, ſuch as never any mean Latiniſt ſpake; whereas notwithſtanding the ſtyle of the Digeſt is very grave and pure, and ſuch as doth not much differ from the cloquenteſt ſpeech that ever the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> uſed; and for the methode, it hath no particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, other than ſuch as is borrowed of the Digeſt it ſelfe, and otherwiſe is rude and unskilfull, where it doth recede from the ſame: yet doth it not lack his good uſe, for to ſuch as follow the practice of the law, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16473:23"/>
of the Code is much more expedient than the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Digeſt is, for that the lawes of the Code doe determine matters in daily uſe of life; which, becauſe they are a like in all ages (for the ſame is evermore upon the ſtage, the perſons a little altered) it cannot be but the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof muſt be very profitable and expedient for the Common-wealth, whereas notwithſtanding the learning of the Digeſt ſtands rather in diſcuſſing of ſubtill queſtions of the Law, and enumerations of the variety of opinions of ancient Lawyers thereupon, which have more commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wit, than benefit toward the common-wealth in them; but hereof hitherto.</p>

In place next after the Biſhops themſelves, comes their power and audience; for albeit the chiefeſt office of a Biſhop, is to inſtruct the people in the doctrine of the Word, and in good example of life: yet foraſmuch as all will not be obedient unto the Word, neither brought by the perſuaſion thereof to good nurture, and to be kept in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the eminencie of the degree, wherein the Biſhops are placed, is not ſufficient to keepe the people in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence without ſome power and juriſdiction, and becauſe the Church it ſelfe is the mother and maintainer of Juſtice, therefore there is by the Emperour himſelfe, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours, as many as profeſſed Chriſtianity, certain pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar juriſdictions Eccleſiaſticall, aſſigned to the Biſhops, more worthy than the Civile, over perſons and cauſes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, ſuch as touch the Soule and Conſcience, or doe appertein to any charitable or godly uſes: and over the Laitie, ſo farre forth, as either the Laitie themſelves have beene content to ſubmit themſelves unto their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, ſo farre as either it concernes their Soules health, or the outward government of the Church in things decent or comely, or that it concernes poore and miſerable perſons, ſuch as widowes, orphans, captives, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like helpleſſe people are, or where the Civile Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate cannot be come by, or doth voluntarily delay judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in all which, anciently a Biſhop was to performe double faith and ſanctity; firſt of an uncorrupt Judge, and then of a holy Biſhop.

How ſuch as are in debt to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, and their ſuerties are to be ſued. Of the right of thoſe things which the Exchequer ſels by outcry, where he that offereth moſt, carrieth it away, and how the ſame may be revoked, unleſſe all rights and ceremonies be ſolemnly performed therein. How things that are in Common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Ecchequer and private men, may be ſold, and that the Exchequer evict nothing that it hath once ſold, for that, it were a thing againſt the dignity of the Exchequer, and would terrifie private men for bargaining with it.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16473:25"/>
and what penalty they incurre, if they repay it not at their dayes covenanted, ſomtimes the forfeiture of foure double of that they have borrowed, ſomtimes danger of life it ſelfe. That in caſes of penalties, the Exchequer be not preferred before ſuch as the Offender was truely indebted unto, but that they be firſt ſerved, and then the Exchequer have onely that which is left. What uſurie the Exchequer may take, that is, for money lent, and not for ſuch ſummes as grow out of Mulcts and Penalties. That ſuch ſentences that are given againſt the Exchequer, may be retracted within three years following, although ordinarily all other Sentences are irrevocable after ten dayes; neither can be reformed after that time, either by reſcript of the Prince, or by pretence of new proofe. Of the goods of ſuch as excheat, by reaſon they have made no Will, and of the goods of Incorporations, that is, of ſuch as dye without heires, that they come not to the common banke of the citie, but that they excheat unto the Prince: Of Promoters, by whoſe informations any goods are confiſcate, either by reaſon of the goods themſelves, for that they are adulterine, or that they are prohibited to be exported or imported, or upon ſome other like cauſe, or by reaſon of the perſons that have offended, and crimes wherein they have offended; and their puniſhment, if they give in any wrong information, or other than ſuch as they are bound unto by vertue of their Office: and that they give no information in, but by adviſe of the Attourney of the Exchequer, and that they make no information againſt their Lord and Maſter, but in caſe of Treaſon. That it ſhall be lawfull for no man to make ſute unto the Prince for thoſe things that are confiſcated unto the Exchequer, as though it were more Honourable for the Prince to beſtow ſuch things on his Courtiers, than to keepe them to himſelfe: and therefore, ſuch as are the Princes Secretaries, his Maſters of Requeſts, and others that are of his remembrance, are forbidden to make any Acts, Inſtruments, or other writings hereof, unleſſe the Prince of his owne motion, and at no other mans ſute, will

The Aldermen or Governours of Cities, for that they are imployed in matters of greater ſervices, yet none of them were to be called to any office before he had beene even with the common-wealth, if happely any of them were in debt to it; neither were they or any of them excuſed more than from perſonall ſervices, but in prediall duties, they paid every one according to his rate. But as for Enterlude-players and houſes of baudery, they had no exemption at all, but paid double charges to the reſt. Of Huſband-men, ſome are ſervants, as Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, others are free, as Free-holders, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding themſelves are, as it were, bound unto the ſoyle, and are rated in the Subſidie according to their Acres; and

Country-men, ſuch as were addicted to the ground they tilled, although the ground were their owne, yet could they not ſell it to any man, but to him that was of the mother-village wherein himſelfe was. A Mother-village was that, whence all the villages round about were derived. Although all ſuch huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen as dwell in any village, are to pay Subſidie for ſuch goods as they poſſeſſe, or ſuch lands as they hold; yet one neighbour is not to be diſquieted or arreſted for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans due: for that it is a thing unlawfull to trouble one for another, or not to ceſſe men indifferently, according to the value of their lands, and the worth of their goods. And therefore, the <hi>Romans</hi> in rating of matters of taxes, had firſt Ceſſers which rated men according to that which they thought their ſtate to be: then had they Levellers or Surveyors, who conſidered the rate ſet downe, mended it, and made it even, eaſing ſuch perſons or grounds as were over-rated, and charging more deepely ſuch others as were overlightly taxed, procuring that ſuch grounds as were waſte and barren; ſhould be brought to tillage, and that the barren ſhould be joyned with the fruitfull, that by ſuch meanes the Prince might receive ſubſidie out of both: March-grounds, and ſuch as lie in the bounds of any king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſerve for the maintenance of ſuch Garriſons as are there placed for the defence of the Marches, and ſuch as hold the ſaid lands, are to pay a yeerely proviſion or pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the ſame; as alſo the Princes paſtures, woods, and

                     <p>Of the Decretals there be three Volumes, according to the number of the Authors which did deviſe and publiſh them.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Volume of the Decretals was gathered together by <hi>Raymundus Barcinius,</hi> Chaplain to <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth, at his the ſaid <hi>Gregories</hi> commandement, about the yeare 1231. and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by him to be read in Schooles, and uſed for Law in all Eccleſiaſticall Courts. The ſecond is the worke of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, methoded by him about the yeare 1298. by which, as hee added ſomthing to the ordinance of his Predeceſſours, ſo he tooke away many things that were ſuperfluous and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to themſelves, and reteined the reſt. The third Volume of the Decretals, are called the Clementines, becauſe they were made by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth of that name, &amp; publiſhed by him in the Councell of <hi>Vienna</hi> about the yeare of grace 1308.</p>

Of Truce and Peace which Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Judges are to procure; that truces be kept from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday in the Evening, untill Munday in the Morning, and that there be no fighting from the firſt day of the Advent, until the eight day after Twelfe tide, and that warre likewiſe doe ceaſe from the beginning of Lent, untill the eight day after Eaſter, under paine of Excommunication, againſt him that preſumeth to doe the contrarie; and that in time of warre, neither Prieſts, Clerkes, Merchant-men, country men, either going to the field or comming from the field, or being in the field, or the cattell with which they plough, or the ſeed with which they ſow, be hurt or violated. Judges, before men enter into the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous events of Law, are to perſwade the parties litigant by private covenants and agreements to compound the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie betweene them, wherein if they prevaile not, then the parties are to provide themſelves of Advocates, Proctors, or Sindects according as they are private men, or bodies politick to furniſh their cauſe, and direct them in proceeding.</p>
                     <p>If any Church hath beene hurt in any contract of bargain, or ſale, or in demiſing of any Leaſe, or by the Proctors negligence, it is to be reſtored againe into her former ſtate, to alledge and plead that for it ſelf, which is agreeable to Law &amp; conſcience.

The cauſe being begun, delayes are often granted, if either there come
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16473:47"/>
any holiday betweene, or any other like juſt cauſe be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as for producing of witneſſes and ſuch like: if there be no juſt cauſe of delay, then the Judge is to goe on in the due courſe of Law, (provided alwayes that more be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the plaintife than is due) and that the cauſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſory be handled before the petitorie, and that hee that is ſpoyled, be firſt and before all things reſtored to that thing or place whereof he was ſpoyled, or from which hee was put; yea, though he have nothing elſe to alledge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, beſides the bare ſpoliation it ſelfe. If the one ſide or other wilfully or deceitfully decline Judgement, the Judge is to put the other in poſſeſſion of that which is in demand, or at the leaſt, to ſequeſter the fruits and poſſeſſions of that which is in controverſie; but if both parties appeare and joyne iſſue affirmatively, then is it but a queſtion of Law, and not of fact, neither doth there remaine ought elſe to be done by the Judge, but that he give ſentence againſt him that hath confeſſed it, and put his ſentence in execution. But if iſſue be joyned negatively, then is the plaintife to prove his Libell, ſo farre as it conſiſts infact, by witneſſes which are to be compelled by Law if they will not come, or appeare voluntarily, by publick and private inſtruments, by preſumptions, by conjectures, by oath; which being done, the Defendant in like ſort is to be admitted to prove his exceptions, and cleere his preſcription if he be able to alledge any, in which he is Plaintife, neither is hee bound thereto, before the Plaintife have perfected and proved his owne right.</p>
                     <p>After proofes are brought on either ſide, and the ſame throughly diſputed on by the Advocates, the Judge is to give ſentence, which he is to frame according to the Libell &amp; proofes formerly deduced in the cauſe.

                     <p>Prebends and dignities are preferments for Clerkes, but not for ſuch as are idle or abſent from the ſame without juſt cauſe: but if any Clerke or Miniſter be ſicke, and his diſeaſe be curable, he is to receive the benefit of his prebend or dignity in his abſence, as though he were preſent; but if it be contagious, or uncurable, then he is to be put from the exerciſe of his office, and a helper or coadjutor to be joyned unto him, and they both to be maintained of his ſtipend.</p>

Their triall by water was performed, either in hot or cold. In cold water, the parties ſuſpected were judged innocent, if their bodies were not borne up by the water, contrary to the courſe of Nature. In hot, they were to put their bare armes up to the elbowes, which if they brought out without hurt, they were concerved to be cleere of the crime.

                     <p>The perpetuall right that is betweene paſſengers and paſſengers, and ſaylers and paſſengers is, that in caſe of ejectments, and caſting out of goods, and other merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe into the Sea in time of tempeſts, or other dangers, by rocks or quick ſands, for the lightning of the ſhip, becauſe it is for the common good of all that are in the ſhip, and the preſervation of the reſt of the fraught of the ſhip, it be made up with the common contribution of all: for good reaſon it is, that they whoſe goods are ſaved hereby, ſhould againe with their goods redeeme the others loſſe, according to ſuch proportion of goods, as they have in the ſhip, and the Law of the Sea allowes.</p>
                     <p>But in caſes of Ejectments, the Law of the Sea is this, (which was taken from the people of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> who in old time were great ſeafaring men, and diſcoverers of ſundry countries, whoſe Rules even to this day are holden for good among all Marriners, for the great equitie and indifferencie that is in them) that as well the Maſter or Purſer of the ſhip himſelfe ſhall contribute for the preſervation of his ſhip, as alſo the paſſengers for ſuch ware as they have in the ſhip, of what ſort ſoever it be, albeit happely it be but of ſmall weight, as pearles, pretious ſtones, and ſuch like; and if perchance there be ſome paſſengers in the ſhip, who have no ware nor merchandiſe in it, yet becauſe themſelves are a burthen to the ſhip, eſtimate is to be made of his or their apparell, rings, and jewels, according to which, he or they are to contribute towards the loſſe of ſuch things as are caſt out into the ſea: neither is there any thing in the whole ſhip excepted, ſave only thoſe things which are put therein to be ſpent, for the common good of all, as victuals, fuell,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16473:52"/>
and ſuch like; for thoſe things are not brought in for any one private mans uſe, but for the benefit and ſervice of all: and ſo much the rather, for that if victuals faile, or other like neceſſaries want, every one muſt contribute thereto, or impart of that which he hath for his owne private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion; but of mens owne bodies, unleſſe they be ſervants, there is no rate to be ſet, becauſe a free-mans body cannot be eſteemed.</p>
                     <p>In priſing, eſtimate is to be made as well of thoſe things which are loſt, as thoſe things which are ſaved, and the price is to be ſet downe, not for how much they were bought, but for how much they might be ſold, and that for the preſent, leſt the contributors ſhould be overmuch char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Neither is it to the purpoſe that the goods which were loſt, might have beene ſold for more, for that herein regard is not to be had of the gaine, but of the loſſe. And if any thing that was throwne out were knowne to be decayed or made worſe by waſhing with ſalt-water, it is not to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed as a new freſh thing, but the price thereof is to be abated accordingly.</p>
                     <p>Now the contribution is to be made in this manner, firſt the loſſe is to be ſet downe, then the rate of thoſe things which are ſaved, out of which muſt be drawne an equall portion, porportionable to the quantity of every mans goods he hath in the ſhip, to make up the loſſe, deducting out of the loſers goods for himſelfe, ſo much as is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to his proportion, ſo that he ſhall neither be made a cleere ſaver, nor a cleere loſer, but in a certaine quantitie rateable to his part.</p>
                     <p>But this contribution is in that caſe to be made, if the ſhip be ſaved; for otherwiſe if a wrack happen, either before the ejectment, or in the ejectment, then whatſoever any of the vectors or paſſengers catch, is his owne; neither is there any regard to be had of the loſſe of the ſhip, or of the goods, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perhaps afterwards they be drawne out of the ſea.</p>
                     <p>But here we are to note, that neither the things that are thus ejected, ceaſe to be the firſt owners, neither become his

                     <p>Whereof there be three ſorts, the firſt is matters of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein treatie betweene one Prince and another; the ſecond is the ordering of martiall cauſes, whether they be Civile or Criminall in an Army; the laſt is the Judgements of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes and Armes, and the deciſions for challenges of rights of Honour and precedencie, where any of them is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, whereas all other Nations in compaſſe round about us be governed by the Civile Law, and treaties are to be decided by Law (both for thoſe things which are in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and to be concluded by Law, and for thoſe things which are determined by conſultation and agreed upon) who is thereto to be choſen rather than a Civilian, to whom their law is knowne, as well as to themſelves: and if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he underſtand not their language; yet hee underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that language wherein the lawes themſelves are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and is the fitteſt tongue for treatiſes betweene Princes and Princes, becauſe it is a common tongue to the learned of all the Weſt part of the world, and thereby every Prince ſhall reteine his owne Majeſtie in parlying, as it were, in his owne language, and not be forced to ſpeake in an other Princes tongue, which, no doubt, is a great diſadvantage to him that ſhall treat; for that every Nation hath ſome proper <hi>Idiom,</hi> not ſo well diſcerned by the booke-ſpeaker, as perceived by the Natives of the countrey, where it is ſpoken, and wherein a ſtranger may eaſily be deceived.</p>
                     <p>How much forreine Princes doe eſteeme of the skill of a Civilian in theſe matters, it may be underſtood thereby, that they never, for the moſt part ſend any Embaſſage for the treatie of any league or matter of commerce, but that one or moe of them are Civilians. And if the care of theſe things be ſo great with them, ſurely the eſtimation of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:16473:55"/>
ſame ought not to be light with us: for by what lawes their leagues and negotiations uſe to bee directed, by the ſame muſt ours bee ordered, ſo that for that point, one kinde of learning muſt ſerve for both; for that otherwiſe one Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will not be convinced by the other what their capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are.</p>
                     <p>Surely, ſuch as over and beſides their owne experience, have the knowledge of the Civill Law, have herein a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble helpe above another man that wanteth the ſame.

                     <p>The third ſort is, of thoſe which are private mens Armes, of whom part have them by the grant of the Prince, or by authoritie of thoſe, to whom the Prince hath given power to grant Armes to others, as hath the Earle Marſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Realme of England; others have taken them by their owne authoritie, which albeit in former times they might doe, as alſo they might take ſuch names as every one did like of (for names and ſignes in the beginning were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, for to know and diſcerne one man from an other) and as every man might change his name, ſo might hee change his ſigne, ſo that it were not done in fraud and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit: but after it was forbidden, both that any man ſhould <note place="margin">C. de mutatione nominis l 1. ff. de Falſis, l. ſal ſi nominis.</note> change his name, becauſe it was not thought it could be done with any good meaning, and that no man ſhould beare Armes of his owne authoritie; and therefore Officers were appointed under Princes (as I have ſaid) who ſhould give Armes to ſuch as deſerved well of the common-wealth, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in warre or peace: for albeit in the beginning Armes and Colours were proper to men of warre, to avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in the hoaſt, and to diſcerne one company from an other, yet when it came to be a matter of honour, it was challenged no leſſe by men of peace, than by men of warre; for true indeede is that ſaying of <hi>Tully, Parva ſunt foris

And of colours, the golden co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is the chiefeſt, as that which doth figure the Sunne, which is the fountaine of light, which is moſt acceptable to every mans eye. The next is Purple or Red, which doth figure the fire, that is the higheſt and nobleſt of the foure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, and next the ſunne it ſelfe in dignitie. The third is Blew, of the Heralds called Azure, and <hi>Ceruleus</hi> in Latin, which figureth the Aire, which is a cleere and tranſparent body, and moſt capable of light, and commeth in nobility next after the fire. The fourth is White, which commeth neere to the Light, and therefore is more noble than Black, that draweth neere to darkneſſe, and therefore is the baſeſt of all Colours.

unto the Empire, was toſt up and down many hundred yeares betwixt Inheritance, Bequeſt, and Election, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till at the laſt, it came unto that eſtabliſhed ſtate, as now it is in, and ſetled Electours of the Empire, ſo often as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be voide. Succeſſion in Kingdomes, in moſt part of the world, in former time hath beene, and at this day is by right of bloud, (a few onely excepted, which are Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, as the Kingdome of <hi>Poland</hi> is at this day) and in Succeſſion the eldeſt ſonne taketh place before the reſt; and if there be no heire male, then the eldeſt daughter ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth in the kingdome, and her iſſue: for Kingdomes (as alſo ſucceſſion in other dignities) are impartible. And yet <hi>France</hi> (to exclude <hi>Edward</hi> the third from the inheritance of the Crowne thereof, who deſcended of <hi>Iſabel</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Charles</hi> the faire, and ſo was next heire male unto the kingdome of <hi>France)</hi> alleaged for themſelves the Law <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> pretending none which claimed by the woman, albeit he were the next heire male in bloud, was to ſucceed, as long as there were of the male line alive, how farre ſoever they were off in degree from the laſt King deceaſed. But this is but a meer device of the <hi>French,</hi> fathered upon ſome rotten Record of that part of their Nation, called <hi>Salii;</hi> of whom otherwiſe they have nothing memorable to ſpeake of, as being the baſeſt Nation among them all, of whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their people to have bin compounded: but this deviſe ſerved their turne then, whether it were anciently invented, or newly coyned. But howſoever they oppoſe themſelves againſt womens government, as <hi>Bodine</hi> their countrey-man <note place="margin">Bodin. lib. 6. de repub.</note> hath of late ſtretched out the ſtrength of his wit to deviſe reaſons againſt the government of that ſexe: certaine it is, that the Law of God hath allowed it, as it appeareth in the example of <hi>Debora,</hi> who being a Propheteſſe, governed Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael fortie yeares, and by her direction got the Iſraelites a mightie victorie over <hi>Siſera</hi> the Captaine of the hoaſt of <hi>Jabin:</hi> and wee among other Nations, have found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, <hi>gunaicocratie</hi> or womens government is nothing ſo unfortunate, as <hi>Bodine</hi> would make us beleeve it is.

For both in our late Queene, and alſo in her ſiſter, (except only the caſe of Religion, wherin ſhe followed the error of the time, and was carried away more with zeale than know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and thereby is more to be pittied than to be envied) what is in their government, the wiſeſt Man-Prince in the world would not deſire to be in his owne Regiment? for what is either in their private carriages, (ſo you give no eare to virulent and malitious tongues, who report ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for ſubſtances, and tales for truths) or in their publicke government, (ſo you lay not other mens faults to their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) that any man may juſtly blame? For that I may paſſe over the reſt of their Heroicall vertues, fit for women of their State (ſpecially the late Queene, who was peereleſſe among all Queenes that ever went before her, and unmatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as I verily doe beleeve, by any that ever ſhall ſucceed her) as their magnanimity whereby they ſubdued, not only their domeſticall enemies, but vanquiſhed even their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine foes, were their deſignements never ſo dangerous, not ſhewing any token of diſcouragement, either in the treaſonable attempts of the one, or in the malitious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotments of the other.</p>

                     <p>And yet, truth it is, that mens government is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Nature than womens is, whom God in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning put in ſubjection under man, and who for the moſt part are by nature weake in body, and thereby unable to put in execution the great affaires of a Kingdome, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled

either Juriſdiction is agniſed to be ſetled wholly, and onely in the Prince of this land, ſundry wiſe mens opinion is, there can lye no <hi>Praemunire</hi> by thoſe Statutes at this day, againſt any man exerciſing any ſubordinate Juriſdiction under the King, whether the ſame bee in the Kings name, or in his name who hath the ſame immediatly from the King: for that now all Juriſdiction, whether it be Temporall or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall is the Kings, and ſuch Eccleſiaſticall Lawes as now are in force, are called the Kings Eccleſiaſticall Lawes, and the Kings Eccleſiaſticall Courts; for that the King cannot have in himſelfe a contrarietie of Juriſdiction, fighting one againſt the other, as it was in the caſe betweene himſelfe and the Pope, although hee may have diverſitie of Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction within himſelfe, which for order ſake, and for avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of confuſion in government, hee may reſtraine to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſeverall kindes of cauſes, and inflict puniſhment upon thoſe that ſhall goe beyond the bounds or limits that are preſcribed them: but to take them as enimies, or undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his ſtate, he cannot; for the queſtion here is not, who is head of the cauſe, or Juriſdiction in controverſie, but who is to hold plea thereof, or exerciſe the Juriſdiction under that head, the Eccleſiaſticall or Temporall Judge.

vexation, and have no other commendable end in them, though they pretend the right of the Kings Court, as thoſe other Prohibitions of the Law doe: but the Kings right is not to be ſuppoſed by imagination, but is to be made plaine by demonſtration, and ſo both the Statute of the 18. of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the third, <hi>capite</hi> 5. is, where it is provided, that no Prohibition ſhall goe out, but where the King hath the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gniſance, and of right ought to have; and alſo by the fore-named Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, which forbids that any Prohibition ſhall be granted out, but upon ſight of the libell, and other warie circumſtances in the ſaid Statute expreſſed: by which it is to be intended the meaning of the Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers was not, that every idle ſuggeſtion of every Attour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhould breed a Prohibition, but ſuch onely ſhould bee granted, as the Judge in his wiſdome ſhould thinke worthy of that favour, and if right and equitie did deſerve it: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (as I muſt needs confeſſe) the Statute is defective in this behalfe, for to exact any ſuch preciſe examination of him in theſe caſes, as it is alſo in other points, and is almoſt the generall imperfection of all Statutes, that are made upon Eccleſiaſticall cauſes: but I feare mee as emulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two Lawes, in the beginning brought in theſe multitudes of Prohibitions, either againſt or beſide law, ſo the gaine they bring unto the Temporall Courts maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them; which alſo makes the Judges they ceſſe not coſts and damages in caſes of conſultation, (although the Statute preciſely requires their aſſent and aſſignement therein) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not deterre other men from ſuing out of Prohibitions, and purſuing of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The Prohibitions of the law, as have beene before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are neither many, nor much repined at, becauſe they containe a neceſſary diſtinction betweene Juriſdiction and Juriſdiction, and imply the Kings right, and Subjects bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: but the Prohibitions of fact or of men, are both infinite and odious, for that there is, well nigh, no matter either Civile or Eccleſiaſticall, be it never ſo cleere or abſolute, but they clog and incumber it with ſome Prohibition; and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16473:71"/>
the matter they containe, is (for the moſt part) abſurd and frivolous, as ſhall firſt appeare in marine cauſes, and after in Eccleſiaſticall matters.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>FOr Marine cauſes it is well knowne, that all ſuch bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines and contracts, or as it were contracts, as are made by any perſons either in any forraine countrey, or any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or creeke of the Sea, or any ſhore thereof, as farre as the greateſt winter wave doth runne out, or upon any great river, to the firſt bridge next to the Sea, for any merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, ſhip, tackle, or other negotiation belonging to the Sea, or to any merchandize brought from beyond the Sea, is, and ought to be of the admirall cogniſance, and ſo ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more hath beene ſince the Court of the Admiraltie was firſt erected: and yet the common Lawyers (to defeate the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Law of the triall thereof) have deviſed ſundry actions, and among the reſt, an action of Trover, whereby they faine, that a ſhip arrived in <hi>Cheapfide,</hi> or ſome other like place within the Citie, and there the Plaintife and Defendant meeting together, bargained upon ſome merchandize, or other like ſea-faring matter, by which fiction, they pretend the bargaine now is to be tryed in the Common Law, and not by the Civile Law, as being done in the body of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and not upon the maine Sea, or any other place ſubject to the Admirall Juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>But that this fiction, or any other like qualitied to this, ſhould have any ſuch force, as to worke any effect in Law, I will ſhew, firſt by the definition of a fiction, then by thoſe things that are neceſſarily attendant thereon.</p>
                     <p>A fiction therfore is defined by <hi>Bartol</hi> (whom alſo the reſt <note place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

upon an untruth, for a truth, in a certaine thing poſſible to be done, and yet not done: upon which fiction the Doctors hold, there waite two things, the one is Equitie, the other Poſſibility. For Firſt, unleſſe there be cauſe why, that which is not, ſhould be fained to be, and that which is, ſhould bee accounted not to be, and that which is done in one ſort, or at one time, or in one place, ſhould be imagined to be done in an other ſort, at an other time, and in an other place, there is no reaſon a fiction ſhould be admitted: for the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth no man to come to extraordinary remedies, but where ordinarie remedies faile: and therefore if that which is in controverſie may bee obtained by any other meanes, than by a fiction, a fiction is not to be afforded: but if ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meanes cannot be had, then fictions may be entertained <note place="margin">L. in cauſa. ff. de minorib.</note> to ſupply the defect of the ordinary meanes, that thereby, although the truth be otherwiſe, yet the effect of the Law may be all one.</p>

Infinite more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples might be brought of this ſort, but it would be too long to run through them all, and this ſhall ſuffice to have
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16473:72"/>
ſhewed, that the Law approveth fictions, but where there is equitie for it, and the Law it ſelfe otherwiſe cannot have <note place="margin">L Gallus § fi e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus ff. de liberis &amp; poſthumis. l. ſi pater § ſi cum. ff. de adopt.

And as the Law cannot proceed to a fiction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out equity, ſo neither can it faine any thing that is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for Art evermore followeth Nature; and therefore if a man would faine diſproportionable things, ſuch as the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did in <hi>Horace,</hi> who made Boares wallow in the waves of the Sea, and Dolphins wander in the woods; theſe fictions in no ſence can be admitted, for that they are ſuch, as neither Nature nor Reaſon can brooke. In like ſort, if a man would faine one to live, who were dead two hundred yeares ſince, <note place="margin">Bartol l fi is qui pro empto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re num. 21. 22. 23. &amp; ſequen tib.</note> ſo that it were not poſſible that hee or any of his equals ſhould live at that age, this would not hold in Law, for that it is above the age that the Law doth preſume any man may live by Nature; although the Law doth preſume ſuch as dye in warre for defence of their countrey (for the better encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of thoſe that are alive, to venture themſelves in like ſervice for the common-wealth) to live for ever; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their fame doth flouriſh for ever: and upon like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Law will not ſuffer any perſon to adopt an other for his childe, who is either elder or equall in age unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or is not ſo farre under his yeares, as by courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hee might be his naturall childe indeed: ſo much the Law deteſteth impoſſibilities, that it will not ſuffer a man to faine that which in common Sence and Nature might not be true indeed.</p>
                     <p>Now, if theſe things be true, as in all reaſon and ſhew, by former precedents they appeare to be true, I would gladly ſee how actions of Trover, (whereby the Common Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers tranſlate unto themſelves matters of Marine triall) if they be ſquared to theſe Rules of Fictions, can bee maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: for firſt to ſpeake of equitie, which the Law requires in theſe manner of proceedings, what equitie can it be to take away the triall of ſuch buſineſſe as belongeth to one Court, and to pull it to an other Court; ſpecially, when as the Court from whence it is drawne, is more fit for it, both in reſpect of the fulneſſe of knowledge that that Court
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16473:72"/>
hath to deale in ſuch buſineſſe, and alſo of the competencie of skill, that is in the Judges &amp; Profeſſours of thoſe Courts, correſpondent to theſe cauſes, more than is in the Judges and Profeſſours of the other Courts, for the deciding and determining of theſe matters. For, albeit otherwiſe they are very wiſe and ſufficient men in the underſtanding of their owne profeſſion, yet have they ſmall skill or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in matters pertaining to the Civile profeſſion: for that there is nothing written in their Bookes of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, more than is to be gathered out of a few Statutes of former time, whoſe drift was not to open any doore unto them, to enter upon the admirall profeſſion, but to preſerue the Kings Juriſdiction from the Admirall incroachment, as may by the ſaid Statutes appeare; whereas contrarily, the Civile Law hath ſundry titles included in the body thereof, concerning theſe kindes of cauſes; whereupon the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Law have largely commented, and others have made ſeverall Tractates thereof: So that, by all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, theſe men are more fit and better furniſhed to deale in this buſineſſe, than any men of any other profeſſion, as having, beſides the ſtrength of their owne wit, other mens helpes and labours to relie upon.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, this buſineſſe many times concerns not only our owne countrey-men, but alſo ſtrangers, who are parties to the ſuit, who are borne, and doe live in countries ordered by the Civile Law, whereby they may bee preſumed to have more skill and better liking of that Law, than they can bee thought to have of our Lawes, and our proceedings: and therefore it were no indifferencie to call them from the triall of that Law, which they, in ſome part know, and is the Law of their countrey (as it is almoſt to all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome beſides) to the triall of a Law which they know in no part, and is meere forraine unto them; ſpecially when the Princes of this Land have anciently allowed the Civile Law to be a Common Law, in theſe cauſes, as well to their owne ſubjects, as it is to ſtrangers.</p>
                     <p>Further, the avocating away of cauſes in this ſort from
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16473:73"/>
one Juriſdiction to another, ſpecially when the cauſe hath long depended in the Court from whence it is called, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as now it is ready for ſentence, or rather is paſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and ſtands at execution, cannot be but great injurie to the ſubject after ſo much labour loſt, and money ſpent in waſte, to begin his ſuit anew againe: which is like to <hi>Syſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> puniſhment, who, when he hath with all his might, forced his ſtone up to the top of the hill, and ſo is (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hopes) at an end of his labour; yet the ſtone rowles downe again on him, and ſo his ſecond labour (his ſtrength being ſpent with the toyle of the firſt) is more grievous than the former was: which being ſemblably true in a poore Clyent, who hath his cauſe in hearing, there can be no equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this fiction, whereby a cauſe ſo neere ended, ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine be put upon the Anvill, as though it were ſtill rough worke and new to be begun.</p>
                     <p>And ſurely, as there is no equity in it, ſo there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ſuch a fiction ſhould be maintained by Law; for that it hath no ground of reaſon to reſt his feete on. For if this be granted, that ſuch a fiction by Law may be made, then one of theſe abſurdities muſt needes follow, either that a ſhippe may arive in a place where no water is to carry it, or if that it arive according to the fiction, either the people, their houſes and their wealth ſhall be all overwhelmed in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the world was in <hi>Noahs</hi> Floud, &amp; <hi>Ducalions</hi> Deluge, and ſo no body there ſhall be left alive to make any bargain or contract with the Mariners &amp; Shipmen that arive there; or that the people that dwell there ſhall walk upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as people doe on land, which <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe, but had ſuncke, if Chriſt had not reacht his hand unto him, and therefore far leſſe poſſible for any other man to doe. So that it may bee well ſaid (theſe things ſtanding as they doe) no ſuch fiction can hold, and that no action can be framed upon it; for as there is no Obligation of impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, ſo there is no Action of things that neither Nature nor Reaſon will afford to be done: neither is it to the purpoſe that the maintainers of theſe fictions doe ſay,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16473:73"/>
that in this caſe, the place where the contract is made is not conſiderable, which I take to be farre otherwiſe; for that, when that themſelves will convey a Marine cauſe from the Sea unto the Land, they will lay it to bee done in ſome ſpeciall place of a Countrie, bee the place never ſo unproper for ſuch an action: for that the foundation of theſe actions, is the place where they were done, as namely that they were done in the body of ſuch a Country, or ſuch a Country, and not upon the maine Sea, or beneath the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bridge, that is upon any great river next the Sea. And therfore in two emulous Juriſdictions, when they are ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, as that one is aſſigned the ſea, the other the land, the place of the action can in no ſort be ſuppreſſed, and another ſupplyed in the roome thereof: <hi>Quod enim una via prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur, alia via non eſt permittendum, &amp; quod prohibitum eſt directo prohibetur etiam per obliguum:</hi> for if this were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then matter enough would bee offered to one Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to devour up the other, and the Law would be eaſily eluded: which, to reſtraine either of theſe Juriſdictions to their owne place, and to provide that one in his greatneſſe doe not ſwell up againſt the other, hath ſet either of them their bounds and limits which they ſhall not paſſe: which, as it is the good proviſion of the Law, ſo ought either Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction in all obedience to ſubmit it ſelfe thereunto, for that the diminiſhing of either of them is a wrong to the Prince from whom they are derived, who is no leſſe Lord of the Sea, than hee is King of the Land: and therefore, in no ſort, ſuch liberty muſt be allowed to the one directly or indirectly, as that it ſhould be a ſpoile unto the other; which would eaſily come to paſſe, if when as the Law alloweth not any man to ſue a Marine matter by the ordinary courſe of the Lawes of this Land, yet a man will follow it by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. But where there is an uniformitie of Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as that it is all by ſea and all by land, there may a thing be fained to bee done in one place, that was done in another place, without any mans prejudice, for that in this caſe the place is not traverſable (ſo it bee not in Criminall matters
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16473:74"/>
where time and place is required, that the accuſer doe not wander from place to place with the injurie of the accuſer) for howſoever the place and the action is altered, yet the truth of the cauſe remaineth one and the ſelfe ſame ſtill. And ſo farre as concerning actions of Trover in Admirall cauſes: Now it doth follow, that I ſhould ſpeake of like prejudices that grow to the ſame by actions of Treſpaſſe, but thoſe will I paſſe over, for that in ſo ſmall a Treatiſe as this is, I cannot goe over all: and therefore will I onely put the Reader in minde, that there are more deviſes, riſing out of the Common Law than one, that infeſt the Admiralty.

                     </argument>
                     <p>FOr matters of Wils and Legacies, they are ſo proper to the triall of the Eccleſiaſtical Law of this Realm, that the profeſſors of the Common Law themſelves, doe oftentimes confeſſe and ſay, they have no more to doe therewith, than the Civilian hath to do with the knowledge of the matters of Franktenement: and yet even theſe matters of Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Legacies, although Prohibitions be not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in them, as they are in the reſt of Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, yet they are not quite voide of them, &amp; that in ſome points, wherein the very life and eſſence of a Will doth ſtand.</p>
                     <p>For whereas the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> knowing how ſubject matters of Wils are to forgerie and corruption on the one ſide, and ſuppreſſion and concealment on the other ſide, to meet with all craft and ſubtilty whatſoever, which might ſeize on them, did moſt carefully provide, that there ſhould be ſeven witneſſes, at the leaſt, preſent at the making of every Will &amp; Teſtament, except it were in time of ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall plague or ſickneſſe, when ſo many witneſſes could not conveniently be had together, for fear of infection, or that it
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16473:74"/>
were in the Countrie, where there are ſmall multitude of people. And that thoſe witneſſes ſhould be particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to that purpoſe, with diverſe other obſervations and circumſtances tending all to the ſafe and ſure making there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; which the Eccleſiaſticall Law altered afterward in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry points, for that many true Wils were many times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowne for want of thoſe preciſe ſolemnities. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reduced the whole number of thoſe ſeven witneſſes, unto two onely, agreeably to the Law of God, and the Law of Nations, where that number of witneſſes is allowed, as competent to prove any matter, ſo that the ſame witneſſes be honeſt and credible perſons, ſuch whoſe faith is not doubted of. The Common Lawyers, becauſe themſelves in ſundry matters very dangerouſly many times admit one witneſſe, and give him full credit, and that in matters of great weight and importance, (as though all ſhould bee ſquared to their rule, and framed to their compaſſe) if an Eccleſiaſticall Judge in the probate of a Will, contrary to the rules of his owne Law, will not admit the teſtimony of one witneſſe, they forthwith fling out a Prohibition againſt him, as though he had done an offence againſt the Crowne and dignitie, in that he doth not allow thoſe number of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in the Probate of a Will, that the Common Lawes of this land allow almoſt in every matter.</p>
                     <p>For anſwer to which, if I ſhould alleage the preciſe forme of the Eccleſiaſticall Law, which to the eſſence of a Will requireth this number of two witneſſes, or elſe holdeth it not for a Will (but in caſes <hi>inter liberos, &amp; ad pios uſus,</hi> where the onely hand of the Father or Teſtator without witneſſes ſerveth for a Will, ſo the ſame be knowne to bee the Teſtators owne hand, or ſo proved by compariſon) I would thinke to wiſe men I had ſaid ſufficiently; but I will not reſt hereupon, but will convince themſelves, by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: for, doe they, I pray you, in their own proceedings, where a Law or Statute requires more witneſſes than one, content themſelves with one witneſſe alone; yea, doe they not in all caſes where a certaine number of witneſſes are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16473:75"/>
to prove a fact by Law or Statute, furniſh the cauſe with ſo many witneſſes as the caſe deſires, or elſe doe they not account the proceeding voide? And will they thinke themſelves ſo preciſely bound to the keeping of the letter of the Common Law, and will they not ſuffer the Civilian in like maner, to cleave faſt to the obſervation of the Civile Law, eſpecially when it hath the conſent of the Law of God, and the Law of Nations, and is his Majeſties Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Law of this Land, aſwell as the other is his Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law of the ſame?</p>
                     <p>I confeſſe it may be true many times, which one man ſaith, ſpecially when there concurre therewith many great and violent preſumptions, and the party that reporteth it is of good credit; but dangerous it is to open this gap to the malice of men, for even ſo, many things ſhall bee obtruded to the Judge for trueth, which are ſtarke lyes; and many things ſhall bee pretended to bee gold in ſhew, which in proofe and practiſe will be found to be no other thing, but meere droſſe.

as though the Eccleſiaſticall Judge thereby took upon him to decree which lands were deviſable by Will, &amp; which not, or would by his probate adde a ſtrength unto the Will, to make the deviſe good or bad, whereas on the contrary part, the Eccleſiaſticall Judge by this act doth only teſtifie, that ſuch a perſon made ſuch a Will, &amp; that the ſame was proved before himſelfe under his Teſte, for his laſt Will &amp; Teſtament: but for the validity of the Will it ſelf, &amp; the Legacies and deviſes therein, whether they were of lands or tenements, or of goods or chattels, the Probate it ſelfe worketh nothing, but leaveth that to the Law, Common or Eccleſiaſticall, according as the bequeſt belongeth to either of them, whether it be good &amp; vailable in Law, or no: for it oftentimes falleth out, notwithſtanding the Wil be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully proved before the Ordinary, yet the bequeſts are not good, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of the perſon to whom the bequeſts are made, or in reſpect of the thing that is not deviſable in all, or in part; as by the Common Law, lands in <hi>Capite</hi> cannot be deviſed, more than for two parts, but in Socage the deviſe is good for all; and by the Cuſtome of the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> &amp; ſome other places of the Land, a man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath no more than his deaths part, and if hee doe, his bequeſt is void for the reſt; but in other places of the land a man may bequeath all. By the Civile Law a man can bequeath nothing to a Traytor, or an Heretick, or an unlawfull Colledge, or Company (unleſſe perhaps it be for the aliment, or maintenance of them in extreame poverty, that they die not for hunger, which is the worke of charitie) and if he doe, the legacie thereof is void to all intents &amp; purpoſes. So then, the Probate of the Ordinarie in matters of land, neither helpeth, nor hindereth the right of the deviſe it ſelfe, but is a declaration onely of the dead mans doome uttered before ſuch &amp; ſuch witneſſes: which taketh his ſtrength not ſo much from the Probate, as from the Law, and is teſtified onely by the Probate, that the ſame was declared by the Teſtator, in the preſence of the witneſſes therein named, to be his true and laſt Will. So that no man herein is to be offended with the Ordinary, as preſuming of a matter not appertaining unto him, (for his teſtification in all Law and conſcience doth belong unto him, to give allowance ſo farre unto the defuncts Will, as it is avouched before him to be his laſt act &amp; deed in that behalfe) but rather they are in this caſe to thanke the Ordinary, that he by that act of his hath preſerved the memorie of that, which otherwiſe perhaps would

                     </argument>
                     <p>NOtwithſtanding all which good proviſion of ancient Kings before the Conqueſt, and moderne Kings ſince the Conqueſt, for the aſſuring of the ſuit of Tythes to the Eccleſiaſticall Courts onely, and the continuall poſſeſſion that the Eccleſiaſticall Courts have had of the ſame, deduced from ſo ancient time, as hath beene before ſhewed, and ſo often obteined in contradictorie judgement, as the conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations thereupon granted doe teſtifie: yet ſundry men of this Land, in ſundry ages, have by wrenches and ſubtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes (which are odious in Law, and are by all godly and wiſe Judges by all poſſible meanes evermore to be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) raiſed up matter out of the ſaid Statutes themſelves, contrary to the true ſence and meaning thereof, to draw the triall of moſt of thoſe matters away from the Eccleſiaſticall <note place="margin">L. legata inuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter. ff. de adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendas legatis. l. 2. ante finem.

So that thoſe Statutes which then were intended for the good of the Eccleſiaſticall Courts, are now become the utter ruine and overthrow of the ſame, contrary to the rule of the Law, and common reaſon, that things which were purpoſed for one end, ſhould worke unto an other.</p>
                     <p>The firſt advantage they take againſt the Eccleſiaſticall Courts out of theſe Statutes, is gathered out of the twenty ſeventh, and thirty ſecond of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. where it is orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that all the Kings Subjects ſhall pay their Tythes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">27. &amp; 32.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:16473:80"/>
with all might and maine to draw away theſe things unto the Temporall Courts, as belonging to the Temporall Crowne and dignitie: Wherein they doe wrong, not onely to the Kings Eccleſiaſticall Courts, to ſpoile them of their ancient Juriſdiction, but alſo doe injurie to the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as though he had but one proper Juriſdiction belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to his Throne, and ſeat of Majeſtie, and that which were done by his Eccleſiaſticall power, were done againſt his Crowne and Dignitie; whereas they are equally united in him, and his Throne is no leſſe ſtayed up by his Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall power, than it is upholden by his Temporall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And therefore a meere Paradoxe is that, that they ſo conſtantly affirme, That cuſtomes in payment of Tythes are matters of Temporall cogniſance onely, and not of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall cognition. For, as there be ſecular cuſtomes, ſuch as are the cuſtomes of Mannors and Lordſhips, where the Lord hath his Rent, his heriot, his reliefe and ſervice; and the tenant againe doth his homage and fealtie, according to the nature of his Tenure, which ſecular cuſtomes, the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Statute <hi>De Regia Prohibitione,</hi> forbiddeth Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Judges to deale in: So alſo there are Eccleſiaſticall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, ſuch as is the payment of Tythes, and other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall duties, to which common Lawyers are not to put their hands, but to abſtaine from them, as dedicated to the uſe and triall of the ſpirituall Courts. Otherwiſe would neither the ancient Authors of the Legatines, and Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conſtitutions of this Land (the eldeſt of which, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and the youngeſt of them endeth in the reigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth) ever have <note place="margin">Provincial. c. quoniam de de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimis.</note> changed ſo many ſeverall cuſtomes of payment of Tythes, as then were within the Land, and in ſtead of them, have brought in one uniforme payment of the ſame, as is at this day uſed, ſave where either the negligence of the Parſons, or the covetouſneſſe of the Pariſhioners hath in ſome point changed the ſame. Neither would theſe Statutes of <hi>Henry</hi> the eigth ever have ordered the people ſhould pay their Tythes after the laudable cuſtomes and uſages of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16473:81"/>
where they grew, if the uſage and cuſtome of the payment it ſelfe had not beene ſubject to the Eccleſiaſticall cogniſance: for in vaine ſhall a man ſue for that, the Law allowes him no courſe to come by, if it be denyed in the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialleſt <note place="margin">L.

Thoſe that firſt gave example to others in this matter, are conceived to bee the ancient Roman Biſhops; for it was recorded in the <hi>Pontifical</hi> of <hi>Damaſus</hi> (as ſome would have it) But in <hi>Anaſtaſius Bibliothecar,</hi> wee finde it, that when <hi>Peter</hi> had appointed &amp; ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Prieſts &amp;c. and <hi>Cletus</hi> had reduced them to a certaine number, Pope <hi>Euareſt</hi> aſſigned to each of them his Pariſh, or as they then ſaid, his Title: For ſo a Title is underſtood by <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> and ſo in effect it may be taken, though otherwiſe <hi>Paroecia</hi> is <hi>Accolatus ad ſacram Aedem, Titulus autem Aedes ipſa.</hi> And it may ſeeme, that <hi>Titulus</hi> might bee taken for <hi>Paroecia,</hi> becauſe this hath beene taken for that: For in the Councels wee ſhall ſometimes finde a Pariſh put for a Pariſh Church, which is the meaning of <hi>Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> See <hi>Baronius ad annum Chriſt.</hi> 112. where the learned Cardinall ſetteth downe at large what theſe Titles were, and why they were ſo called. As for the time when theſe Pariſhes were aſſigned by <hi>Euariſt,</hi> it muſt be about the beginning of the 2 Centurie.</p>
                           <p>This done, and the number of new Converts increaſing, <hi>Higinis</hi> placed ſeverall Prieſts in ſingular Pariſhes, and the chiefe of thoſe he called <hi>Cardinales Presbyteros:</hi> and heere we muſt beleeve, that the Romiſh Cardinals began, if at leaſt wee will bee guided by their Hiſtorians. In after-times Pope <hi>Denis</hi> improoved theſe conveniences invented by his Anceſtours, and ſet limits to Pariſhes. And this was done about the yeare 260. If theſe things bee anſwerable, as they are generally received by the Romiſh Antiquaries, then it may ſeeme that other Nations made the like proviſion ſooner or later, according to their example. And this is the rather to be beleeved, becauſe this Pope <hi>Dionyſe</hi> wrote an Epiſtle to <hi>Severus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Corduba,</hi> to obſerve this order in his Dioceſſe, and looke what courſe himſelfe tooke, that hee ſhould direct other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to doe in like manner.

Cardinal.</hi> Otherwiſe, A Pariſh is taken for ſuch a part of the Dioceſſe, which is aſſigned to ſome Prieſt, arbitrarily ſent and maintained by the Biſhop; for it is to bee noted, that ſuch a Pariſh paid all dues to him, and he to his Clergie, for the primitive communitie of living, becauſe of inconvenience ceaſing in the Church, this cuſtome was introduced, that all Church dues ſhould be at the Biſhops diſpoſing, ſo, that being geometrically divided into foure portions, he ſhould have one part, and his Clergie an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the third to be diſſtributed to the pooſe and ſtrangers, and the laſt part to be reſerved to the Pariſhioners for the repairing of Churches.

The Latine Tranſlation of theſe Canons is ſet forth by <hi>Turrian</hi> and <hi>Alphonſ. Piſan.</hi> and is to bee found in the 1.

Some ſay, that theſe Canons are ſuppoſititious; I only know that they may bee ſo, not that they are: and however it be dull to entertaine any thing that ſhall be obtruded, yet the rejection of ancient Authors and Councels ſhould be warily concluded upon. Thus much notwithſtanding is recorded, that by reaſon of the Arian incendiaries, a compleat number of the Canons of this Councell was ſo rarely found, that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> himſelfe, who was preſent at the Synod, was forc't to ſend into theſe parts, to the Biſhop of Rome that then was, to deſire from him a perfect copie, becauſe in the Eaſterne world, few or none had eſcaped the fire of the Arians.

                           <p>Concerning the originall of a Pariſh in theſe two former Acceptions, it may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to bee a device of the ancient Roman Biſhops, and to have beene derived from them to other Nations. But a Pariſh may be alſo taken for ſuch a part of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, which is limited to ſome reſidentiarie incumbent, allowed by the Biſhop, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Church dues in his owne right. And this conſideration of a Pariſh moſt of all agreeth with thoſe which we now have. And it may very well be ſuppoſed, that theſe later Pariſhes have had their beginning from the inconveniences of the former. And the deſignement and limitation of theſe, how ever it might have ſpeciall encouragement from the devotion of lay men, yet the principall ſtroke was alwayes given by the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, to whom it pertained to conſecrate the Churches, and make them baptiſteriall. And that the dividing of Pariſhes ſhould of right belong unto Eccleſiaſticall men, it may be the more reaſonable, becauſe the firſt that ever divided any Pariſhes were the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Biſhops, and they did not onely ſo, but alſo gave direction to other Prelates in their ſeverall Provinces to doe the like, oſpecially if that be true, which wee have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cited out of that Epiſtle of Pope <hi>Denis</hi> to the Spaniſh Biſhop.

So that if the matter ordered in the Law or Statute be Temporall, the cogniſance ſhall bee Temporall; if Spirituall, then the caſe is determinable in the Eccleſiaſticall Law: for this Proviſo is not prohibitorie,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16473:86"/>
as the laſt Proviſo of this Satute is, whereby Eccleſiaſticall Judges are forbidden to hold plea of any thing that is in the ſaid Proviſo conteined; but it is rather directive, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where the Eccleſiaſticall Judge is to give way to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, and to pronounce for them: ſo that for any thing is conteined in this Proviſo to the contrary, the cogniſance of theſe matters, eſpecially, Priviledge, Preſcription, and Compoſition, ſtill remaineth at the triall of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Law, as they did before this Proviſo was made for <note place="margin">Depraſcript. lib. 2. tit. 26.

And that the King doth infuſe life into either of the Lawes, when as yet their ſubſtance is unperfect, and they are as it were Embryons, is in temporall matters, by his temporall authoritie, and in ſpirituall matters, by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall authoritie, for to that end he hath his double digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in that place, as alſo the Eccleſiaſticall Prelates ſuſtaine two perſons in that place, the one as they are Barons, the other as they are Biſhops: So that even the orders of the Houſe doe evince, that there are two ſorts of Lawes in that place unconfounded both in the head and the body, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for communion ſake, and to adde more ſtrength to each of them, the generall allowance paſſeth over them all.

                     <p>BUt here it will not bee amiſſe to inquire, (ſince Tythes came in the beginning of the primitive Church, within a little time after the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Jewes policie, unto the Chriſtian Church and common-wealth, void of all theſe incumbrances, as ſhall appeare after by the teſtimonie of ſundrie of the ancient Fathers, which were neere the Apoſtles time) how it comes to paſſe (ſince Tythes are no leſſe the Lords portion now, than they were then, and in the Patriarches time before them) that theſe greevances have come upon them more under the Goſpel, than ever they did under the Law: for then never any Lay man durſt ſtretch out his hand unto <note place="margin">Malach. 3.</note> them, to diminiſh any part thereof, but hee was charged with robberie by the Lords owne mouth; and in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, the heavens were ſhut up for giving raine unto the earth; and the Palmer-worme and Graſhopper were ſent to devour all the greene things upon the earth.

                     <p>THe beginning whereof, although it be hard for mee to finde out, becauſe there is ſmall memory thereof left in Stories; yet as farre as I can by all probabilities conjecture, this great alteration in Eccleſiaſticall matters, came by two occaſions: the one by the violence of the Laitie, thruſting themſelves into theſe Eccleſiaſticall rights, contrary to the firſt inſtitution thereof; for when they were firſt received into the Chriſtian world, they were received and yeelded to for the benefite of the Clergie onely, as in former time under the Law, they had beene for the uſe of the Prieſts and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>evites onely: The other was, the too too much curioſitie of Schoolmen, who being not content with the ſimple enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of Tythes into the Church, as the ancient Fathers of the primitive Church received them, would needes ſeek out how, and in what right, and in what quantitie this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion belongs unto the Church, wherein they did by their overmuch ſubtilty, rather confound the truth, than make that appeare which they intended to doe. By the firſt of theſe was brought in that great Preſcription, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Preſcription beyond the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell, whereby Lay men held Tythes in fee, without paying any thing therefore unto the Church; and out of that iſſued the reſt of thoſe pettie Preſcriptions, which wee now have, which are nothing elſe but imitations of the firſt. By the ſecond came in Priviledges, Cuſtomes, and Compoſitions; or if they came not in wholly by them, yet ſurely were they much ſtrengthned by them; but of either of theſe after in their places.

                     <p>It is out of queſtion, that from the time of <hi>Origen,</hi> who lived within foure ſcore yeares after the death of Saint <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, as alſo did <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who was his coë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in time, and ſo along by the ages of <hi>Chryſoſtome, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and ſome of the purer Popes, as <hi>

Homily upon <hi>Numbers,</hi> ſpeaking of Tythes, ſaith thus, I hold it neceſſarie that this Law or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept be obſerved according to the letter: and upon the 22. of <hi>Mathew,</hi> hee thinketh Chriſts words uttered there as concerning Tythe, to be a precept no leſſe neceſſarie for the uſe of Chriſtians, than they had beene for the Jewes: and therefore hee accounteth Tythe neither ceremoniall, nor Judiciall, but morall and perpetuall. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Lxvi.

In the ſame Booke, Chapt. 35. which is <hi>Des Diſmes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feodees,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feudation of Tythes, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventureth to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the received opinion. The maine reaſon hee urgeth (as farre as I conceive him) is, for that thoſe who firſt and anciently wrote the Hiſtorie of their Kings, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe tooke notice of the acts of <hi>Charles,</hi> doe not accuſe him of any ſuch Infeudations. But to this I ſuppoſe ſome anſwer may be conceived in this manner.</p>
                           <p>The principall Hiſtoriographer of whom wee are to conſider in this caſe, muſt bee <hi>Aimoine,</hi> who wrote the Storie of the <hi>French</hi> Kings, and what was delivered in his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle concerning the times wee aime at, for the moſt part, made up the Bookes of thoſe Writers that ſucceeded, for ſome certaine centuries of yeares. This <hi>Aimoine (Stephen</hi> ſaith) maketh no mention of that Act of <hi>Martel:</hi> 'tis true, neither maketh he mention of any Sacriledge at all, no not ſo much as <hi>Stephen</hi> himſelfe, and all Writers beleeve that <hi>Martel</hi> was guilty of: And I ſhould wonder if hee had, for <hi>Aimoine</hi> lived in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and what he wrote concerning him and his anceſtours, hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Autmare</hi> Chaplaine to the ſame <hi>Charles,</hi> and this is too neere the time of <hi>Martel</hi> for a true Hiſtorian. Indeede the lives of pious Princes may be written before their deaths, and if there happen an unworthy paſſage, it is not corrected in their Storie, but their Converſation: But when a great King proves not good, his firſt Hiſtorians muſt be worſe, for no Subject may dare to write what ſuch a Soveraigne could commit. And therefore if an ill Act occurre, the Hiſtorian muſt diſſemble or defend it; for what e're be after thought of great mens actions, yet when they are newly done, either they muſt not be mentioned, or if they be, they muſt be magnified. Therefore <hi>Autmare,</hi> who depended upon <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, muſt not tell ſuch tales of his Grandfather. And for this cauſe it is, that when <hi>Aimoine</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>Martel,</hi> he ſtyles him <hi>virum ſagaciſsimum,</hi> and <hi>virum egregium,</hi> adding moreover that his atchievements were accompliſhed <hi>Chriſto in omnibus praeſide:</hi> See <hi>lib. 4. c.</hi> 57. where alſo relating his victories, he compareth the ſiege of <hi>Avignon</hi> to that of <hi>Iericho,</hi> as if <hi>Charles</hi> had march't on like thoſe great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the wals of <hi>Avignon</hi> had fallen downe like thoſe of <hi>Iericho</hi> at the very ſound of <hi>Martels</hi> Trumpets. Thus <hi>Aimoine</hi> obſerves the time hee lives in. So <hi>Boniface</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> in <hi>Martels</hi> dayes, though perhaps hee could have ſaid more than hee did, if that be not enough which hee hath ſaid, that this <hi>Charles</hi> was <hi>Eccleſiaſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum pecun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the truth muſt be, that if <hi>Boniface</hi> have any ſuch thing to ſay of <hi>Charles,</hi> hee muſt ſend it farre enough, for it might not bee told at home.</p>
                           <p>That which hath beene ſaid may paſſe for a reaſon, why ſo great a crime of <hi>Martel</hi> was not ſo publickly recorded till time could weare out the danger, and the Hiſtorian could write the Act with as much confidence and ſecuritie as <hi>Martel</hi> did it. Therefore it is, that though the Writers began betimes to touch at his impietie, yet they ſtruck not at this maſter piece but by degrees.</p>

This <hi>Dupleix</hi> was a later writer than the reſt, and one that hopeth to bee accounted a better, as it ſeemeth by the cenſure, which in his Preface hee paſſeth upon thoſe who wrote before him. But let us heare what hee ſaith in defence of <hi>Martel: D'ailleurs ils furent encore plus offenses de ce qu' apres la journee de Tours</hi> (ſo the <hi>French</hi> call this expedition of <hi>Charles) il recompenſa la Nobleſſe de partie des diſmes du Clerge a vec promeſſe de reſtitution: de laquelle de puts il ne tint compte. Mais en cela l'ingratitude &amp; l'avarice du Clergé eſt plus blaſmable que l'entrepriſe de Charles. Car n' eſtoit il pas raiſonnable que ceux qui apres beaucoup de deſpence avoient exposé ſi genereuſement lour vie pour la de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe de l'Egliſe fuſſent recompenſes de quelque petit portion du revenu d'icelle? &amp;c.</hi> Hee granteth the paſſage, But (ſaith hee) in this the ingratitude and avarice of the Clergie is more to be blamed, than the enterpriſe of <hi>Charles,</hi> for was it not good reaſon, that thoſe who beſide their coſt and charges, had ſo generouſly hazarded their lives for the defence of the Church, ſhould bee rewarded with ſome ſmall portion of the revenue thereof? &amp;c. Wee anſwer, that the deſigne it ſelfe was truely honourable, but for <hi>Charles</hi> to free the Church from a forraigne Foe, and be a Barbarian himſelfe at home, makes his atchievment very improper, and utterly darkens the reputation of ſo great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
                           <p>Thus wee ſee, that it is generally beleeved by the <hi>French</hi> Writers of later times, that their <hi>Martel</hi> diſtributed the Church Tythes to his men of warre, and that without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration. And if it be asked, from what head theſe moderne Hiſtoriographers could deduce that paſſage, whereof the ancient had made no mention; it may be replyed, that though this were not publickly recorded by the old Writers <hi>Aimoine</hi> and the reſt, yet it might remaine in the Notes of private men, and being delivered from hand to hand, might be reſerved for ſuch a time as could indure the relation.</p>

                           <p>It was ſtrange indeede, that thoſe inconceivable tortures of the damned could be made fantaſticall, and that which cannot be feined ſhould be ſeene in a viſion: yet we may not thinke theſe latter times ſo incapable of a wonder, as not to admit of ſomthing that is ſtrange, we need not goe farre back for a prodigie; what thinke we of the Starre in <hi>Caſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pea,</hi> which ſhewed it ſelfe in the yeare 1572. and the men are yet alive who ſaw it. An ordinarie Starre it muſt not be, for the countrey Hinds had ſpy'd it firſt, and brought the newes to <hi>Tycho:</hi> a fixed Starre it could not be, for ſuch as thoſe are above a twelve-moneth ſtanding: that it ſhould be a Comet, it cannot be granted, at leaſtwiſe not one of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi> for all thoſe are placed below the Moone, but this Meteore was ſublimated above all pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

True it is, that matters of this nature were moſt frequent in the primitive times, yet if wee ſhould admit nothing of this kinde without Chriſt or an Apoſtle, all Stories would be Legends, &amp; almoſt every diſcourſe too ſtrange to be true. But it ſeemeth very convenient for the ſatisfaction of reaſonable Creatures, that theſe things ſhould be ſo, for if God did not ſomtimes interrupt the common courſe, wee ſhould dote upon the ordinarie meanes, and begin to think, that Nature had no ſupreamer cauſe than it ſelfe. If the Storie of this viſion ſhould not be true (wee will not ſay in every circumſtance for wee have promiſed to doubt of the damnation of <hi>Charles,</hi> yet, I ſay, if ſome thing like to this hath not been) then what ſhall be thought of all thoſe ancient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of grave and learned men who are engaged to make this good. To let paſſe the reſt, what ſhall we thinke of the Relation of <hi>Fauchet,</hi> that a Chronologer ſhould ſay, <hi>Que de ſon temps pluſi urs gens l'aſſeuroyent comme a yans eſté preſens a la viſitation de ladite ſepulture &amp; les Eveſques des Provinces, de Rheimes &amp; Rouen aſſemblez en un parlement tenu l'an huit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                           <p>That wee may know what <hi>Fauchet</hi> ſaith, wee muſt obſerve, that in the yeare 858. the Biſhops that then were of <hi>Rhemes</hi> and <hi>Roan</hi> were ſummoned to a Councell by <hi>Lewis</hi> the third, but fearing (for good cauſes) what the ſucceſſe might bee, they appeared not, nevertheleſſe they wrote an Epiſtle to the Emperour, where, amongſt other matters, adviſing him to vindicate the Church, they peremptorily alledged the damnation of <hi>Martel,</hi> and that when he was look't for in his grave by <hi>Boniface</hi> and <hi>Fulrade,</hi> he could not be found, but that in ſtead of him, there iſſued forth a fearfull Dragon, leaving the place all black, as if it had beene burn'd.

This manner of baptizing the ancient Church entertained, from the example of our Saviour who baptized <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Iordan.</hi> And ſome ſay, that this was very tolerable in thoſe Eaſterne parts; but certaine it is, that it was moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>venient for that time, becauſe their Converts were many, and men of yeares. A reaſon alſo may be, for that thoſe ages were otherwiſe unprovided of Fonts and ſuch conveniences which are now in uſe: and this hath beene a cauſe, why this manner of baptizing was reſum'd in after-times, and other places, for our venerable <hi>Bede</hi> telleth us of ſome that were baptized heere in <hi>England</hi> in the River <hi>Swale,</hi> which runneth through a part of <hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> in the <hi>North Riding,</hi> and hee giveth the ſame reaſon: <hi>Nondum enim Oratoria vel Baptiſteria in ipſo exordio naſcentis thi Eccleſia poterant adificari. Eccleſiaſt. hiſt. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 14.</p>
                           <p>The dayes we now live in have no other remainder of this Rite of Baptizing in Rivers and Fountaines, than the very name; for hence it is, that wee call our veſſels that containe the water of Baptiſme Fonts, or Fountaines.</p>
                           <p>This cuſtome of Baptizing in Rivers and Fountaines being diſcontinued, Fonts were erected in private houſes; but the violent perſecutions of thoſe times barr'd the Chriſtians of that convenience, therefore their next recourſe was to woods and devious places, and there they accommodated themſelves with ſuch Baptiſterials as they could. In more peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ages they drew nearer, and made bold to build their Fonts a little diſtance from the Church; afterwards they obtained, that they might bee ſet in the Church-porch; and at laſt got them into the Church. But they were not placed in every Church; for at the firſt they were onely found in Cities where the Biſhop himſelfe reſided, and onely in the great Church of ſuch a Citie; and though Service might be ſaid in the leſſer Minſters and rurall Churches, yet the right of Sepulture and Baptiſme belonged to the Cathedrall Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it were in caſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and it was therefore called the Mother-Church, becauſe that as the people in their Mothers wombe were borne Men, ſo in the Fonts of Baptiſme, as in the Churches wombe, they were borne Chriſtians. In ſucceeding ages, when it was found that the Mother church was too farre diſtant from ſome Villages, and ſo ſituated, that in the Winter time the people could not repaire thither, conſideration was had of this inconvenience, and the Biſhop tooke occaſion from hence to transferre the right of Baptiſme and Sepulture to the Rurall Churches, and this, together with the right of Tythes, &amp;c. made it a Parochiall Church, of that kinde which wee now have. But becauſe alſo in many Pariſhes ſome Families liv'd ſo remote from their Church, that they could not conveniently frequent it, it was indulged to thoſe, that they might build themſelves either in or neere their manſion-places a private Oratorie, reſerving for the moſt part, the right of Baptiſme and Sepulture to the Pariſh-Church, which, in reſpect of theſe leſſer Oratories, was to be accounted their Baptiſmall and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Church. It was alſo provided, that theſe Families, notwithſtanding their grant of a private Oratorie, ſhould upon high dayes repaire to their chiefe Church, as it ſeemeth by the Councell held at <hi>Agatha Can. 21.

Reverent Judges of the Land, upon an erroneous report made in the eight yeare of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to the contrarie, viz. That no Eccleſiaſticall Judge will admit any Plea in diſcharge of Tythe, or the manner of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as it is in their ſenſe taken; and therefore they hold whatſoever the Defendant doth alledge in his ſuite for a conſultation, and namely that the Eccleſiaſticall Judge did allow of the Plaintifes Plea and allegation, and did admit him to the proofes thereon without deniall, are idle ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp; rather words of courſe than of effect and ſubſtance.

than for the diſlike of the Church, that it was ſo ordered.</p>
                     <p>For if that courſe had beene holden on ſtill, the greateſt part of the livelihood of the Common-wealth would in ſhort time have come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, and ſo Lay-men ſhould not have beene able to have borne the publicke burthens of the Common-wealth; which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes Secular Princes to be carefull of, and to foreſee, that by over-much bountie towards the Church, they impoveriſh not their owne ſtate, and loſe the right of Eſcheats, Primer ſeiſin, and other Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dges of the Crown in caſes of forfeiture, and ſpecially make bare their Lay-ſubjects, upon whom a great ſervice of the Common-wealth doth lye. And yet otherwiſe the beneficialleſt ſtate of this Realme unto the Prince is the Clergie, as from whom the King hath a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall revenue in Tenths, and is deepeſt in Subſidie, and not the leaſt in all other extraordinarie charges, according to the proportion of their place.

                     <argument>
                        <p>That the admiration which theſe Religious Men did breed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the head of Princes and Popes, did procure appropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Parſonages, and Immunities from Tythes. And that the over-conceit which men had of Prayer above Preaching in the Church, was an adjuvant cauſe thereunto.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN this zealous bounty of every degree towards theſe new ſorts of men, there are two undigeſted Priviledges granted them, both of them ſo hurtfull and injurious to the Church of God, as never any was the like. The one was the Annexation or Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation of preſentative Benefices to theſe Religious Houſes: The other, the freeing of ſuch Lands or Hereditaments, as they held in ſundry Pariſhes from the payment of Tythes to the Parſons and Vicars thereof; to both of which the School-mens Divinity gave great advantage, as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Either of theſe had their beginning of one roote, that is to ſay, of this falſe ground, that Preaching, which is the moſt true, and moſt naturall foode of the Soule, in a Congregation that is come to the profeſſion of Religion already, and knowes but onely the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, the Lords Prayer, the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, <note place="margin">Linwood provin, eiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, de of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic.

By which,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:16473:101"/>
and other like arguments, they tranſlated away that maintenance that was provided for the home Paſtors, (who by Gods owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, were to watch over their Soules) to forreine and ſtrange Guides, who never communicated to their neceſsitie in any hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly comfort, but onely tooke the milke of the flock, and fed themſelves withall. But by this pretence of theirs, ought not Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to have beene diſgraced; for albeit Prayer bee a neceſſarie peece of Gods ſervice, and ſo neceſsary, that the Soule of man is, as it were, dead without it, yet is it not <note n="†" place="margin">
                           <p>But here it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will neede, that the Reader uſe a ſober judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for it cannot but bee thought une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould bee ſo unwarily plac'd in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, as that Prayer ſhould loſe by the compariſon. There may bee alwayes neede of Preaching, but then moſt of all, when the Auditorie is unchriſtian. This reaſon prevailed for all places in the firſt times, but in theſe laſt onely for ſome, according to which it were unprofitable to goe about to convert the <hi>Indies</hi> no otherwiſe than by our Prayers. Yet even in thoſe primitive times, which had moſt cauſe to call for Preaching, we ſhall find that this duty was of rarer exerciſe, &amp; leſſe ſolemnity than that of Prayer, as it may abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly be diſcovered out of the Liturgies of both the Charches. And it is obſerveable, that where Preaching hath beene of the greateſt account, it hath bin ſo much beholden to Prayer, that it was not onely begun and ended, but alſo diſcontinued by devotion: For wee ſhall finde the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Fathers <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> of <hi>Seleucia</hi> at prayers in the middle of a Sermon: See the one in his 39. <hi>Orat.</hi> the other in his 3. <hi>Hom.</hi>

                           <p>All this while wee would not detract anything from Preaching, but conſidering our ſelves to live under a State ſo maturely compoſ'd, and ſo throughly adviſ'd and ſetled in the Faith, it will be expected, that we ſhould ſo farre moderate our opinion of Preaching, as that our magnifying thereof, may no way tend to the diſcredit or diſadvantage of moſt neceſſarie Prayer.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt how theſe annexations of Benefices firſt came into the Church, whether by the Princes authoritie, or the Popes licence, it is very diſputable, and there are reaſons on both ſides for to ſhew the ſame.</p>
                     <p>For whereas there are reported by <hi>Ingulphus</hi> Abbot of <hi>Crowland</hi> before mentioned to have beene eight Churches, beſide the Patronage of ſome other, annexed and appropriated to the ſaid Abbey, by ſundry <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, it doth not appeare, by ought I can finde, whether they were done by the ſoveraign authoritie of the Kings alone, to the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that, that was done by <hi>Martellus,</hi> who made all Chriſtian Kings to ſinne in this point, or that it was done by any other Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall authoritie, for that there is nothing extant for the allowance thereof, ſave the ſeverall Charters of thoſe ancient Kings only: &amp; that I ſhould bee the rather induced to beleeve that it was done by thoſe Kings authoritie only, I am thereto perſuaded, for that I finde <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> immediatly upon the great victory that hee got over this Kingdome, to have appropriated three Pariſh Churches to the Abbey of <hi>Battaile,</hi> which hee built in memory of his Conqueſt. And whereas <hi>William</hi> his ſonne had depopulated and overthrowne ſundry Churches in the new Forreſt, <hi>Henry</hi> his brother by his Letters Patents gave the Tythe therof to the Cathedrall Church of <hi>Sarum,</hi> &amp; annexed thereto twenty other Churches in one day; if the copie of that record that I have ſeene, as concerning theſe appropriations, be true, yea the matter was gone ſo farre in thoſe daies, that even Noble perſons and other meaner men, would command Corodies and penſions to their <note place="margin">Anno 1. Edw. 3. c. 10.</note> Chaplaines, &amp; other ſervants, out of Churches, and this could not be redreſſed, untill ſuch time as there was made a Statute to reforme it.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary ſide, that I ſhould take it to be a deviſe of the Pope, I am moved thereto, for that I finde every of theſe orders of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men were confirmed by one Pope or other; &amp; as they confirmed them, ſo it is like they made proviſion for them, &amp; that moſt eſpecially this way, &amp; that chiefly after the Laws of Amortiſation were deviſed, <note place="margin">Linwood c. licet bona memoria. Gloſſ. in verb. aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt non logari, de locato &amp; conducto.</note> &amp; put in ure by Princes: &amp; thereupon it is that we find ſundry ſorts of annexation made by Popes &amp; Biſhops under them, every one in their Dioceſſe: as ſome were made ſo far as concerned the Patronage only, &amp; then had the Monks therein preſentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only: ſome other were made <hi>pleno jure,</hi> &amp; then might the Monkes both inſtitute &amp; deſtitute therein

without the Biſhop, and turne all the profit thereof to their own uſe reſerving onely a portion to him that ſhould ſerve the Cure there: ſome other Churches did they grant ſimply to them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any addition of full right, or otherwiſe: &amp; then if the Church were of their owne foundation, they might chuſe, the Incumbent being once dead, whether they would put any other therein, unles <note place="margin">† By occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that which the Authour here ſaith, and that which hee hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Patrons penſion from the Biſhop, <hi>Chap. 5. Sect.</hi> 1. of this 3. <hi>Part.</hi> It ſhall be here enquired, what Right and Title the Dioceſan had to a new Church, or Monaſterie, and how it ſtood in compariſon of the Patron; and becauſe this Right ſeemeth originally to diſcover it ſelfe in the Founding, Erecting and Endowment of a Church or Monaſterie, (by all or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which the Law ſaith a Patron may be made, the Biſhops conſent alwaies preſuppoſed, as hereafter ſhall appeare) therefore in the firſt place it muſt be conſidered, how farre forth the Biſhop was concern'd in theſe, that it may the better be underſtood, how truly hee was qualified to the Right of Preſentation. For that which concernes Foundation and Erection. All that the Patron had free to himſelfe in the firſt place, was but his Thought, he might thinke where he would deſigne the Ground, or How he might Build the Church; and if he entertained his owne Motion, hee might make it his purpoſe. But this was nothing without Execution; and to this the Dioceſan was to bee required, as the moſt principall and moſt effectuall Agent; therefore it is ſaid in the 4. Canon of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedow,</hi> that no man ſhall erect <gap reason="foreign">

And <hi>Lambertine</hi> ſaith, that this was ſo neceſſarie, that if a Church were ſet up in the Patrons ground without his conſent, the Patron could not pull it downe without the Biſhops conſent; yet if the Patron built a Church upon his owne ground without the Biſhops conſent, the Biſhop might pull it downe without the Patrons conſent, and yet in this caſe the Patron might not doe it without the Biſhops conſent, &amp;c.

For the authoritie of theſe Canons, it may now be thought too late, and to little purpoſe to ſpeake: and yet I have alwaies marvelled who that ſhould be, that durſt be ſo bold, as to faſten ſo many forged precepts upon the Apoſtles; and much more, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he were, hee could be ſo fortunate in his fraud, as not to be diſcovered rather in the next Age, than in thoſe later times, which ſaw the former at a diſtance, &amp; may be thought to know but a little of that which was then done. True it is, that ſome of theſe Canons may ſeeme to argue, neither the Spirit, nor Style of that Age, in which they pretend to have beene brought forth: and yet of others we are bound to thinke more ſoberly.

For a Monaſterie, certaine it is that none could be admitted, but by the Biſhops authoritie. This was determined in ſeverall Synods, we note onely the forenamed Councell held at <hi>Nice,</hi> becauſe there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the reaſon of this is ſet downe, let the Reader ſee the 14.

                           <p>In the filling of Appropriations, which were made over to the Religious Houſes, the Law ſaith that the Biſhop had this power: That he could binde the Proprietaries to ſet out for the Vicar Incumbent, ſuch a Convenable Portion of the Incomes, as the Biſhop in his judgement ſhould be pleaſed to allot.

That we may the more certainly know, what the Emperours minde is, it muſt be conſidered out of <hi>Panormitan,</hi> what is the meaning and originall of the Patrons Right, which by the Canon is called <hi>Ius Patronatus,</hi> and by the Common Law <hi>Advouſon.</hi> The Abbot out of the Law ſaith, that this is <hi>Ius honorificum, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſum &amp; utile alicus competens in Eccleſia, pro eo quod Dioceſani conſenſu Eccleſiam fundavit, conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xit, veldotavit, ipſe, vel is à quo cauſam habuit.

But <hi>Paſcalis</hi> the ſecond, caſting a more favourable aſpect towards Monkes, and other Religious men, than any of his Predeceſſours before time had done, did order together with the Councell of <hi>Ments,</hi> That neither Monkes, nor other Religions perſons, or any other that lived in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ſhould pay Tythes of their own labours: Which immunitie in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <note place="margin">Eod. in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta gloſ.</note> of time, Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> recalled, ſo farre as it concerned the reſt of the Religious perſons, and limited it onely to the <hi>Cyſtertians, Hoſptal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> Templers, and thoſe which were of the order of S. <hi>Johns</hi> in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> leaving onely to the reſt freedome from paying Tythes of lands newly broken up, and laboured with their owne hands, and of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and of their cattell. In which ſtate the matter ſtood untill <hi>Innocent</hi> the thirds dayes, who although hee were in no other point of better mould than the reſt of the Popes were; yet was he in this more pittifull towards poore Incumbents of Pariſh Churches, than any of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours had bin; who ſeeing hereby the inconveniences of beggery and ignorance that grew upon ſundry of the Parochian Prieſts, by meanes of theſe Priviledges, ordered in the ſecond <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell, holden in the yeare of grace 1120. that for ſuch lands as any of the ſaid foure Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <note place="margin">C. nuper Abbates, de decimis.</note> orders, ſhould acquire, and get after the ſaid generall Councell, they ſhould pay Tythes, or compound for them as other men did, yea though they laboured them with their owne hands, or manured them at their owne charges.

But betweene this interruption of not paying of Tythes,

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:16473:108"/>
Church only: then began they freely to ſpoyle the Church of her due Tythes, and to give away that to one Church, that was due to an other. And the reaſon that perſwadeth the School-men to this, was, that after much adoe, dividing the whole Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> into three parts, the Morall, the Judiciall, and the Ceremoniall; they did conclude, that there were three parts likewiſe in the Tythe, the one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, which was a neceſſarie maintenance for the Miniſter, and therefore was naturall and perpetuall: the other Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall, which was the number of ten, fit, as they taught, for that people onely, and therefore was poſitive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motive: the laſt Ceremoniall, and that was the myſterie contained in this Quotitie, or number of Ten, which being but a ſhadow onely, was aboliſhed with the Law it ſelfe: whereby they did inferre the preciſe number of Ten being taken away, by reaſon of the Ceremonie it ſelfe, a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie now onely doth remaine for the Miniſter out of the Tythes: which opinion hath beene well confuted of late, by a very learned man, as his Treatiſe thereof doth well ſhew; but I feare with leſſe ſucceſſe, than the truth of the cauſe doth deſerve, for this is a point that toucheth many mens private benefite, and therefore ſhall have no more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour than it needs muſt.</p>
                     <p>But the deviſe whereon the School-men did build this <note place="margin">Thom. in quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet part. 3. art. 6. q. 6.</note> Ceremonie is this, that as all Digits under ten are unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and doe tend to ten as to their perfectneſſe; ſo all men, ſave Chriſt alone, are unperfect, and have need of Chriſts righteouſneſſe to make them perfect: Which <hi>Abraham</hi> well knowing, paid Tythes to <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> who was the figure of Chriſt, as therein acknowledging, that himſelfe and all mankinde, who were repreſented by the other nine Digits were unperfect by reaſon of Originall Sin dwelling in them, and therefore had need to bee perfected by Chriſt, <note place="margin">Idem part. 22. q. 87. art. 1.</note> who was figured by the tenth number.</p>
                     <p>All which that we may grant to be true betweene Chriſt and all mankinde, as it is true indeed, and that ten is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the other numbers under ten, for that all the reſt

of the Digits, when they come to ten, returne back againe to ten, and are multiplied by the coupling of themſelves with ten: yet, where is this proportion betweene Chriſt and ten in the Scripture, that ſhould make this Ceremonie? which if it cannot be found any where, nor any conſent of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church ſhewed for it, as I thinke it cannot be, then may it with as good authoritie be rejected as it is received. For albeit <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> himſelfe was tearmed a Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall Doctor, that is, ſuch a one as had a ſenſe in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the holy Scripture above all others of his age, and that he did much profit the ſtudie of Divinity, with his wittie diſtinctions: yet is not his authoritie ſuch, that it muſt prevaile in caſes of Divinitie, without the authoritie of the Scripture, and the conſent of the ancient Fathers of the primitive Church, interpreting this peece of Scripture in that ſenſe as he doth, which would make a ſweet harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny if it might be had.</p>

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:16473:109"/>
by like reaſon in the tenth, wherein alſo by like ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance there are two parts, the one naturall, the other poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. The naturall is this: that God our of all the fruits of the earth, the increaſe of cattell that are worthy of him, and fit for mans uſe, ſhould have a tenth, both in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his univerſall government over us, and alſo for the proviſion of his miniſters, and therefore this remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: &amp; in that ſence immediately after the diſolution of the Jews policie, the good Chriſtians of the Primitive Church, as ſoone as they could get any outward forme of a Church, &amp; peace from perſecution received it in the very quotitie, as a thing no leſſe belonging to their Miniſters, than it did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to the Prieſts, &amp; Levites of the Law: But that the Lord annexed theſe Tythes by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Prieſt &amp; Levites for their maintenance, during the time of the diſpenſing of the myſteries under the Law, this is poſitive, and therefore changed by the good Chriſtians in the Primitive Church, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Jewes Eccleſiaſtiques to the Chriſtian Eccleſiaſtiques.</p>
                     <p>Neither can it be thought that this number came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Judiciall part of the Law, as a fit proportion to maintain one Tribe, out of the revenues of the other eleven Tribes: for that this number, or quotitie was revealed to be Gods long before the Law, and before there were any ſuch diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tribes among the people of Iſraell; which then were not, but were parted afterward by <hi>Moſes</hi> into families ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of the twelve ſonnes of <hi>Jacob.</hi> And therefore it is not to be preſumed, that the Law which came long after, imprinted a forme upon that, which was ſo long in beeing before there was any Law or Ceremony. But as the Apoſtles, or prime Chriſtians, vvhen as they did firſt change the day of the Sabbath by divine inſpiration, or otherwiſe, from the day of the Creation, to the day of the Reſurrection, durſt not ſubſtitute any other day into the place of the firſt day, than a ſeaventh; for that the Lord had revealed his pleaſure in many places of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as concerning that number, for his day of vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſo that no other day could be appointed for his day
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:16473:110"/>
of worſhip than a ſeaventh: So neither durſt the good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of the Primitive Church (moved no doubt with no other inſtinct then the other were, when they tranſlated this proviſion of Tythes for their miniſtery from the Jewiſh Church unto their owne Church) change the number of ten into another number beſides, more or leſſe: For that God had no leſſe manifeſted his will in ſundry parts of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as concerning this number, to be a number for the maintenance of his miniſtrie, than he had declared his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as concerning that other number to be a day for his honour, challenging it every where in the Scripture, in the very quotitie for his owne right, and counting it robberie if it were at any time with-holden from him. And therfore it may be well thought, the School-men herein did great wrong to the Church, who by their quaint diſtinctions brought this certaintie into an uncertaintie, which is no where to be found in the Scripture. Which I am more bold to ſpeake, for that I ſee ſome have trod this path before me, and ſhewed by good demonſtration, that the turning of this quotitie into a competencie is a thing nothing warrantable by the word of God, but that the quotitie ought ſtill to ſtand as a perpetuall right due to God and his Church.

                     <p>BUt here is occaſion offered by the example of our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King, to wiſh that ſuch as were authors to the King, for the diſſolving of Monaſteries, and other houſes of Religion, had beene likewiſe Councellers to him for the reſtoring of all appropriated Parſonages of Tythes, which were, as it were, in captivitie under thoſe houſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion unto their proper pariſhes from vvhence they vvere taken. Which had beene a memorable vvorke, and eaſie to have beene perſuaded, the King having ſo many great mountaines of temporalties and Seas of goods, and chatels come unto his hand: ſo that theſe ſpiritualities would have ſeemed matter of ſmall account unto him in compariſon of thoſe other great riches &amp; poſſeſſions, that came unto him. Which if it had beene done, how bleſſed a ſtate and Church had this beene, when every congregation ſhould have had a ſufficient proviſion to maintaine a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Preacher among them: for ſo was it by the firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo continued, till violence, and ſuperſtition chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it.

So dangerous a thing it is, to mixe our own ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or any other carnall conſideration with Gods glory. But, God be thanked, ſuch is the carefull conſideration of our moſt gratious Governour, that now is, in this behalfe, that it may be hoped, that God will remember him, and his poſteritie in goodneſſe, according to all that good that hee hath done for the Church, that hee and his poſteritie after him, may ſit upon his Seat ſo long as the Sunne and Moone endures: for certainly, his godly and gratious comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath beene ſuch hitherto, as that hee may bee verily thought to be a man according unto the heart of God, as <hi>David</hi> was.

                        </note> For ſome Earths doe as naturally yeeld ſtones, and other minerals out of them, as others bring forth Corne, Hay, and other fruits: which if it be true in thoſe bodies which are in the upper cruſt of the Earth, why not alſo in thoſe bodies which are found and framed below in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix thereof? And if theſe bodies doe both ingender and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, which are conceived ſo farre below in the Navell of the Earth, why is not Tythe due of them, aſwell as it is of other fruits that are in the ſummitie or heigth of the earth? Whether is it, that Gods hand leſſe laboureth in the procre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of theſe ſubterraneous bodies, than it doth in the ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and quickning of that fruit, that ſprings out of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per face of the Earth? But that is farre otherwiſe, for here in theſe upper fruites, one planteth, an other watereth, and God onely gives the increaſe: But in the other Minerall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, God alone doth all, for hee only is the planter, hee is the waterer, and he gives the increaſe alone. Or is it that God hath leſſe delight to be honoured with theſe hid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the earth, than he hath to be worſhipped with the labour of the plow, or the increaſe of the cattell of the field? But, that this is not ſo, it is plaine by the glorious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that <hi>Salomon</hi> made, which had not only Cedar trees for <note place="margin">2. Chron. cap. 2.</note> the roofe thereof, and Algummin wood for the ornaments thereof, but alſo had quarrie ſtone for the wals thereof, and gold of <hi>Paruaim</hi> for the beautifying of it, and for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying of it within. And of all other kinde of Mettals, Gold is firſt remembred in the Scripture, immediately after the <note place="margin">Geneſ. 2. verſ. 11 &amp; 12.</note> creation of the world, ſo that God himſelfe may ſoeme to have a ſpeciall regard of this Mettall above the reſt, for that this alone above all the reſt, by purifying is not diminiſhed. Or is it, that God loveth his Miniſters leſſe than other men, ſo that hee would have the Laity to have all the precious things of the earth, and his Miniſters to have no part of any other thing, but that which is vulgar and common? But
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:16473:117"/>
how unlike that is, who ſees not, when hee ſeeth that God hath committed unto them, the ineſtimable treaſures of his word; in compariſon where of, both theſe upper fruits of the earth, and thoſe hid treaſures below, are meere droſſe and corruption? and therefore it is not like, when he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them thoſe great matters, hee would deny unto them theſe ſmaller bleſſings. Or is it, that there hath beene paid Tythes of the upper fruit of the earth already, and therefore cannot Tythe be twice demanded of one ground <note place="margin">Ca. ex parte de Decimis, &amp; ibi Ab. 18.</note> in one yeare, according to a new over-ruled doctrine? But that opinion is both contrary to Law many hundred yeares obtained in the Church without contradiction, whereby it is ordained, that as often as the earth fructifieth in one yeare, ſo often ſhall Tythes in the ſame yeare bee paid of it: and alſo it is contrary to Divinitie and reaſon, that it ſhould bee otherwiſe. For when as God hath given thee more Harveſt or more Vintages in one yeare, is it not both godly and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, as God hath increaſed his bleſſings towards thee, ſo thou alſo ſhouldeſt riſe in thank fulneſſe towards him? For, where every one hath received more grace or more favour, there ought he to be more thankfull, leſt God for lack of this correſpondencie in thankfulneſſe, bring thy nine parts, for thine ingratitude towards him, to a tenth onely. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely ſo hee is able to doe, by ſending deluge and drought upon the earth, by bringing barrenneſſe upon it, by deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is ſprung out of the earth already, by ſtorme and tempeſt, by the Graſhopper and the Caterpiller: for all this hath hee threatned to all thoſe that are unthankfull this way, neither is the Lords hand more ſhortned now than it was then. Whereas notwithſtanding to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hee hath promiſed great kindneſſe unto ſuch as ſhall pay their Tythes truely and cheerfully, as that hee will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the windowes of heaven, and powre out his bleſſings without meaſure upon them. <hi>Hilarem enim datorem amat Deus.</hi> Beſides this, the earth that bringeth out mettals in the matrix of the earth, is not that that bringeth out corne and graſſe in the top of the earth: for that earth that is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:16473:117"/>
the mother of mettals, being preſt downe farre into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of the earth, can yeeld no ſuſtenance to thoſe fruits that grow ſo many fathoms above it, to which it conferres nothing ſave that it doth ſupport and beare up that other earth, which nouriſheth the plants and fruits of the upper earth, whoſe ſuſtenance is not fetch't deep out of the earth, but is ſuckt out of that earth which is with in one cubit, or two of the top of the earth: which may eaſily be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by thoſe fruits and trees that grow upon hard rockes neere to the top of the earth, whoſe food, although it be neere unto the top of the earth yet do they flouriſh, and ſtand faſt, as other trees and fruits doe, which have more fat and deepe mould under them. And therefore cannot the Tything of thoſe things which are above, excuſe the Tythe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the treaſures that are below, albeit the concluſion were true, that two things are not to be paid out of one ground in one yeare, for theſe are not one ground, and the concluſion it ſelfe is erroneous, and therefore I conclude this point thus: Since Mettals and minerals, and other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous bodies are in no leſſe Obligation to God, than other fruits of the earth are, there muſt be no leſſe Tythes paid of them, than are of other fruits of the earth: for that theſe are the inward fruits of the earth, as well as thoſe are the outward, and therefore of like things, there muſt be like judgement and like conſequence.

not ſeparated from the body, and maſſe of the reſt of the earth. For if Tythes ſhould be yearely paid thereof, as it is paid of other things that grow out of the earth, all the whole earth in a ſhort time would become the Clergies. But if it be meant of earth that is ſevered from the reſt of the maſſe, and globe of the earth, then is it otherwiſe. For that earth that is thus ſevered from the other earth, is no more part of that earth from whence it is ſevered, than a mans hand, or leg being ſever'd fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body, is part of his body after it is cut off from it. And therefore of this earth ſo provided for fewell, may Tythes as well be paid, as of any other fewell of wood, cole, or otherwiſe that is provided to be burnt. For there is one reaſon of things, when they are united together in one body, and another of thoſe things, when they are divided from the ſame bodie: for ſo long as they are in one and the ſelfe ſame body, they follow the nature of the whole, but when they are divided, then is there another conſideration of them. <hi>Separatorum enim ſeperata eſt ratio, &amp; ex ſeperatis non infertur de uno ad aliud.</hi>

                     <p>This proviſo hath two branches, the one for compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive barren heath, and waſte ground, the other for abſolute barren heath, and waſte, for either of which is aſſigned a time of ſeven yeares, either for the paiment of ſuch Tythes, as before the time of their improvement, and converting to arable, they were charged with, or for the free and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute diſcharge of them from all manner of Tythes for ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whole yeares next after their improvement ended and determined. For ſo I take the Statute meant, when as it made the one Tytheable, the other not, for if otherwiſe they had beene both in one predicament of the barrenneſſe, the ſtatute had not made the one free from Tythe for ſo many yeares as it doth, and charged the other all that tune with Tythe.</p>
                     <p>For theſe two kindes of grounds, although the Statute ſay nothing, which is comparative barren, which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:16473:119"/>
yet reaſon telleth us, that is comparative that hath a poſitive under it, and a ſuperlative above it: and therefore that is comparative waſte, barren, or heath, in reſpect whereof there is ſome over ground more or leſſe, vvaſte, heath, or barren, ſo that it hath ſimply and poſitively in it ſome condition of heath, waſte, or barren: but if it hath nothing of any of theſe qualities in it, then is it neither heath, barren or waſte, howſoever long otherwiſe it hath lien unmanured, and not turned to tillage: For it is not the turning of a ground to tillage that makes it heath, barren, or waſte, but it is the ill diſpoſition of the ground it ſelfe, ſubject to theſe inconveniences, that cauſeth it not to be turned to tillage; for no man will willingly till that, where the gaine of the tillage will not quit the coſt and labour of husbandrie, as for the moſt part it falleth out theſe grounds that they doe not.</p>
                     <p>Barren ground therefore ſimply, is that which being eared, yeeldeth not the ſeede againe, or at the moſt, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſo ſmall advantage for the tillage, as that the tenant <note place="margin">Gloſ.

whereby it is commonly ſaid, Money is loſt by the uſe thereof, not that money doth periſh or decay by uſe, for wee ſee the cleane contrarie to that, for though money goe thorough a thouſand mens hands, yet it is ſtill of the ſame value, and remaineth in her proper eſſence or being: but that the uſe of money is in the laying of it out, and that by the uſe thereof, money paſſeth from him whoſe it was, and the propertie thereof goeth to another, and therefore as to the firſt owner it is ſpent, and loſt: without which looſing, money naturally gaineth nothing; for lay it up in a coſter or cheſt never ſo long, it will never be the more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, although perhaps as S. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>It will gather a ruſt</hi>

                     <p>Although heath ground, and barren ground be almoſt Synonomies, yet to ſpeake properly, heath is as it were an effect of barrenneſſe, for that there is no ground that bringeth forth heath, but for the moſt part it is barren. And therefore as heath it ſelfe is an unfruitfull kinde of ſhrubs, and is good almoſt for nothing but for the fire; for that neither growing or cut downe, it hath any beneficiall uſe at all for the common wealth: ſo alſo the ground it ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out of, hath neither faireneſſe to the eye, nor good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the yeeld, but is commonly either a blacke ſower ground, that hath no ſweetneſſe at all in it, or is a drie hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie ſoyle, ſuch as evermore cryeth give, give, and never reſtoreth ought againe. <note place="margin">Proverb. 12.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Waſte is that which for the unfruitfulneſſe thereof hath layen time out of minde unmanured, in which ſence it is all one with barren ground; or it is ſuch ground as for the charge of hedging, ditching, fencing, and tilling no man will manure.</p>

Our forefathers anciently compriſed all theſe three un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one name, calling them them all by the name of <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> that is, new-broken-up-ground, not onely becauſe they were not broken up in the memorie of man before, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, for that being eared, they yeelded little or no fruit at all: and therefore the interpreters of the Law defining what <hi>Novalia</hi> are, ſay, that they are ſuch grounds as before the tillage therof were <hi>inutilia;</hi> &amp; example them out, in Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, <note place="margin">C. commiſſum de decimis ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo inutilia.</note> Marſhes, Thickets, and ſuch other unprofitable ground, as out of which before the ſtocking of them up, and converting them to tillage, the Church tooke little or no benefit at all. And thoſe are the ſame or coſen German to thoſe which this Statute calleth heath, barren and waſte, for they are one and the very ſelfe ſame vvith them, in all the chiefe points, for which they are excepted out of the Statute.</p>
                     <p>So then now, there is no further queſtion what is heath, barren, and vvaſte ground, but who ſhall trie the matter of this quality; whether the Eccleſiaſticall Judge, in whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall poſſeſſion this triall hath beene untill now of late, that under colour of this Statute, it hath bin incroched upon as it may appeare by all the Titles of the Eccleſiaſticall Law, where there is any mention of the Tythes of new broken upground, and the decrees of the Lawgivers in the ſame, betweene the Monaſtories challenging them by graunt, and the Parochian Miniſters of the Pariſhes vvhere they grew, claiming the ſame by right: Or the Temporall Judges vvhoſe is the Cogniſance of the Tytle, and Tenure of the ground, as alſo is the ſetting, letting, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſelling, and other alienating of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>For the point it ſelfe, the Statute maketh no mention but paſſeth it over with ſilence; and therefore it is to be preſumed that it meant, that it ſhould there reſt, where it was before the making of the Statute: for the Statute was not made in derogation of the Eccleſiaſticall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that were before; but in affirmance thereof, as the whole drift of the ſaid Statute doth ſhew.</p>

                        <pb n="227" facs="tcp:16473:120"/>
And if the Statute had meant otherwiſe, it vvould ſurely have expreſſed it either in the proviſo it ſelf, or after in the derogatory clauſe; where it maketh an enumeration of ſuch things as it intended ſhould be exempted from the tryall of the Eccleſiaſticall Law, and by vertue of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, ſhould not be compriſed under the ſame, among which there is no word of this proviſo, or any other in the ſame Statute before named.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it unto the purpoſe, that the Common Law of this Land taketh knowledge of the Tenure and Title of Lands, and ſuch other complements belonging to the ſame; for theſe things that are here in queſtion, are no part of thoſe Legall Eſſences, which the Law requireth to the Tytle and Tenure thereof, as is Fee-ſimple, Fee-taile, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of like nature, according to the learning of that Law, but theſe are certaine accidents over and beſide the Tenure of the Land which may be preſent or abſent without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie of the Tytle: as God many times turnes flouds into wilderneſſe, and ſprings of vvater againe into drineſſe, and a fruitfull Land makes hee barren for the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them that dwell therein, and yet the Tytle or Tenure of the ground is not changed, by theſe changes of qualities, but remaines the ſelfe ſame that it was: ſo that theſe things are no more ſubject to the ordering of the Common Law, than it is in the Common Law, to judge and determine what mould is white and what is blacke; what ground will beare wheat, vvhat barley, vvhat oats; for theſe things are no matters of skill of Law, that they need to be fetcht out of bookes, but they are matters of common experience which every country man can as well skill of, as the greateſt Lawyer that is, and therefore the Law in this caſe is not deſirous of any curious proofe, but contenteth it ſelfe onely vvith the depoſitions of two or three honeſt men, which ſpeake ſenſibly and feelingly to the point that is in hand, vvhich is enough to direct any wiſe Judge in his ſentence, ſo that it needs not theſe long circumſtances of twelve men to teach the Judge what, and

how truly the witneſſes have depoſed. For if every qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the ground reſteth in the mouth of twelve men onely, then ſhould no man be able to ſay out of the mouth of a witneſſe, and pronounce thereupon, this ground is mountaine, this is plaine, this is medowe, this is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, unleſſe hee were warranted by the verdit of twelve men thereunto: which if it be an abſurditie to hold, then ſure it is a like abſurditie to ſay, that barren, &amp; heath, waſte cannot be pronounced without a Jurie, for that theſe things are like obvious to ſenſe, and of like qualitie as the others are.</p>
                     <p>And I pray you, when they have drawne it unto their tryall, what do they in effect otherwiſe than the Ecclehaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Judge would or ſhould have done, if it had remained ſtill under him? for do they give credit ſimply to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the Jurie, as touching that which hath beene decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and pleaded in the cauſe before them, or do not the Judges themſelves rather make a briefe of all that hath beene pleaded in the cauſe before them, and thereof make as it were a verdit, and put the ſame in the mouth of the twelve for their verdit, before they goe from the barre? So that the whole weight of the cauſe ſtandeth rather in the Judges direction, in ſuch ſort as it is at the Eccleſiaſticall Law, than it doth in the mouth of the Jurie; for the Jurie men for the moſt part, are ſimple people, and ſcarce foure of the twelve underſtand their evidence: ſo that it may ſeeme rather to be a matter of ſuperfluitie than of good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, to referre a matter to their verdit, vvhen as they ſay no other thing, than what the Judge taught them before; <hi>Stultum eſt enimid facere per plura, quod fieri poteſt per pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciora:</hi> for albeit perhaps ſome capricious fellow of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, upon the confidence of his owne braine, ſometimes ſtart aſide from that which the Judge hath told him, and draw the reſt of his fellowes, as ſo many ſheepe after him; yet for the moſt part the Judges voice is their direction, their loadſtone, and the North pole to guide them in this buſineſſe.

Beſides, in this Proviſo, as in ſome other precedent, there is a great diſadvantage offered to the Clergie, which they much complaine of, and that is, that in caſes of this nature, they are compelled to ſuffer triall under them, who are in a manner, parties unto the ſuit, by reaſon of the intereſt they have therein, either in preſent, or in conſequence; ſo that many now adayes (learning too late by other mens harmes what the event in their owne cauſe will be) chuſe rather to loſe their right, than to venture their cauſe upon ſuch partiall Judges, as the twelve men are.</p>

                        <p>That the Boughes of great Trees are tytheable, and ſo alſo are the bodies, but in the caſe of the Statute onely.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ANd ſo far as concerning thoſe prohibitions which are forced out of this Statute, for naturally they grow not out thereof: ſo that I might now paſſe over to the other branch of my diviſion, that is, of ſuch matters as are now held by the Common Lawyers, to bee in a certaine meaſure onely of the Eccleſiaſticall proceeding, but were anciently wholly of the Eccleſiaſticall cogniſance; but that the name of the Statute, <hi>De Sylua caedua,</hi> offering it ſelfe unto mee in the concluſion of this Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, gives mee occaſion to ſpeake ſomthing thereof, before I come to the reſt.</p>
                     <p>This Statute, as the words thereof doe ſhew, was made in behalfe of the Laitie againſt the Clergie, for the exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of great Woods of twenty yeares growth and upward, from the payment of Tythes; and that in three caſes onely, where the wood was great, when it was xx. yeares of age and upward, where it was ſold to Merchants, either to the profit of the owner himſelfe, or in ayde of the King in his warres; ſo that without theſe caſes, it ſeemeth the Statute intended no further exemption: for Statutes are things of ſtrict Law, and are no further to bee extended, than the words thereof give matter thereunto, eſpecially when
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:16473:122"/>
the thing it ſelfe naturally was liable to ordinary courſe of the Law, as other things of like nature are, and the Statute comes in derogation of their ordinary courſe: as in this caſe, great timber anciently was no leſſe tytheable than ſmall trees are, and ſo by nature ought to be, if the Statute were not to the contrary; yet notwithſtanding theſe limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the ſame, if great wood bee cut downe to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe than to ſale, as to build, or to burne to a mans owne uſe, a prohibition in this caſe lyeth, and yet is there no Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of reaſon to extend it, nor any abſurdity would follow, if it were not extended; for here is neither money ſought, (which gave occaſion unto the Law-givers to make this Statute of exemption) neither is it an unnaturall thing, for to pay Tythes of great wood; for before this time they were paid, and by the Law of God, it ſeemes, they ought to bee <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 6.</note> paid; for that he that is taught, ought to communicate to him that teacheth him in all things: and therefore ſince the reaſon that moved the Law-givers to order it ſo in one caſe, ceaſeth in the other, there is no reaſon of exemption; and when there is not an Identitie of reaſon in the things that are in demand, there can no ſound inference be brought in from the one to the other, for of ſeverall things, there is a ſeverall reaſon, and a ſeverall conſequence; neither can there bee framed thereof a good implication, either poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, or remotively: neither hath this interpretation of theirs any warrant of Law for it, ſave that it hath beene ſo defined and decided: but what is that to the purpoſe, if it hath beene wreſted and wronged contrary to the true ſenſe of the Statute, and that by thoſe that take benefit thereby, whoſe partiality being taken away, the thing it ſelfe would eaſily turne againe to his owne nature, and right would take place?</p>
                     <p>The reaſon they yeeld for the exemption of great woods of the ages aforeſaid, although to themſelves it be plauſible, yet to others it is ſtrange, as namely, that great Trees are <note place="margin">Plowd. in Soby contra Molyns.</note> part of the Free-hold, and that men uſe not to pay Tythes of their free-hold, but of thoſe things which ſpring out of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:16473:122"/>
their free hold, as out of Corne, Graſſe, Fruit, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whereas indeed the talleſt Timber tree, that is, if it were as high as the higheſt Cedar in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> is no more part of the inheritance or free-hold, than the loweſt bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that groweth in the field; for they are both equally part of the ground wherein they grow, and doe take alike nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment and ſuſtenance from the ſame; neither doe they differ in that they are trees the one from the other, <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dùm magis &amp; minus,</hi> as the Logicians ſay; but in that, the one is a great tree, and the other a ſmall ſhrub: and the cauſe of this proviſion here in <hi>England</hi> for theſe great trees, was not for that one was more of the inheritance than the other, but for that the one yeeldeth more profite to the common-wealth than the other, and therefore they have made the cutting downe of the one, more penall than the other: as in like caſe by the Civile Law, whoſoever privily cutteth downe, or barketh a Vine, an Olive, or a Fig-tree, or doth <note place="margin">ff. Arborum fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim caeſarum, toto tit.</note> any other unlawfull act, whereby any fruitfull tree, or any Timber tree doth periſh and decay, it is Theft; and it is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the double value of the hurt which is done, and if he be Tenant to the ground which hath done this villany, he loſeth his hold: which commeth not of that, that one kinde of Tree hath more ſtate in the ground than an other hath, but that the Law hath reſpected, the neceſſary uſe of the one more than the other.</p>
                     <p>By the Civile Law, although this word, Wood, be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <note place="margin">L. Ligni appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione de Leg. 3 et L.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:16473:123"/>
or fagot, in ſuch ſort, as there could be no other uſe thereof than to burne, then it is otherwiſe: for by this meanes, of great wood, it is become ſmall wood, as being cut out in ſhides or ſplinters, fit for to burne. So that in the reckoning of the Civile Law, Timber ſtands not onely in the nature of the wood it ſelfe, but is in the deſtination and purpoſe of the owner, who according to his good liking may make that wood, which is fit for timber, fire-wood, or timber: which if it were ſo in account with the great Lawyers of this Land, the Church ſhould have more Tythes of Wood ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for fewell, and leſſe ſuite for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>As they exempt the bodies of great Trees above xx. <note place="margin">Plowd. ut ſupr.</note> yeares growth, from payment of Tythes, ſo alſo they free the boughes thereof, upon this reaſon, that the boughes thereof are fit and ſerviceable for building, which although happily may be in ſome of them that are next to the Trunck of the tree, yet it is farre otherwiſe in thoſe that are more remote from the ſame, whereof there can bee no other uſe, than to burne: and therefore the Law preciſely holds, in caſe where wood is bequeathed, by which is meant fire-wood onely, unleſſe the Teſtator otherwiſe expreſſe his minde, the lops of timber trees, which the Law cals <hi>Supera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">L. Ligni Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. §. Ofilius De Leg. &amp; Fod. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>materiarum</hi> are bequeathed, for that the lops have not that uſe that the Timber hath, that is, to build or prop up withall, but they ſerve to burne onely: By which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ends, there is ſeverall conſideration and account made of them.

                     <p>Further, how the Boughes of a tree that are of the ſame ſubſtance, as the body of the tree is, ſhould be acceſſories to the tree, I ſee not, for nothing can bee an acceſſory to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is of the ſame nature and ſubſtance as the other is; as the legge, or hand, are no acceſſaries to the body, for
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:16473:123"/>
that the legge or hand are of the ſame ſubſtance that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is: The Child, neither while it is in the Mothers wombe, <note place="margin">L. 1. ff. de ventre inſpiciendo.</note> neither after it is borne, is an acceſſorie to the Mother, for while it is in the Mothers wombe, it is part of the wombe, and after it is ſevered from her wombe, it is a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man like principall as her ſelfe is: But that which is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory to an other, muſt be of an other nature than the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall is; ſo in naturall living creatures, haire, hoofes, hornes, and finnes, and ſuch other like excrements, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſories to the creature whoſe they are, for that they are of a farre different nature from the bodies, out of which they come: and ſo in other naturall things not living, as the Earth it ſelfe is, the Trees, Graſſe, and fruit that ſpring out of the ſame, are acceſſories thereto. Further, in Civile mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, expences and executions are acceſſories to the cauſes out of which they riſe: and in Marriages, Dowries, and Jointures are accounted acceſſories to them, for that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">L. dotis ff. de jure dotium.</note> Marriage, neither Joynture nor Dowrie can ſtand.

                     <p>Now upon theſe grounds to exempt Timber Trees whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the ſervice of him, that is Lord aſwell of the tall woods, as of the low ſhrubs, is very hard, for though him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe dwels not in houſes that are made with mans hand, nor hath any need of tall Trees to repaire his Tabernacle, or prop up his dwelling: yet ſince hee hath left ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, as have charge of his flock, and feed them in word and worke untill hee come, and they dwell in earthly habitations, as other men doe, and their edifices and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings have need of repaire, in like ſort as other mortall mens houſes have, being all in like manner ſubject to rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſſe and corruption; great reaſon it had beene to have allowed him ſome proportion of theſe great woods, tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards his ſervants neceſſary uſes, during the time of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice here, and if not in the very tenth it ſelfe, yet in the xxx. xl. or l. part of the ſame, that God thereby might have beene aſwell acknowledged to be the Lord of the great Oakes of the Forreſt, and that by him they have their length, breadth, and thickneſſe, as he is accepted and reputed to be Lord of the ſmall brambles and buſhes of the field: for as now the caſe ſtandeth, God may either ſeem to have forgot himſelf, that hee hath not made timber trees tytheable, as hee hath done other ſmaller woods, eſpecially having ſuch occaſion to uſe them, both in the Chancels of Churches that are dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to his uſes, and alſo in the buildings and repairings of his Miniſters houſes, who ſupply his roome in their ſeverall Congregations, untill hee returne to Judgement; or that may well be objected againſt us, in allowing ſuch things for Tythes as us pleaſe, and diſallowing the reſt, as was by that ancient Father of the Church <hi>Tertullian,</hi> objected againſt the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> who being intreated by the Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> (for the ſtrange wonders and miracles he heard to

In theſe actions, hee that ſued <hi>ad publicam vindictam,</hi> and had followed ſo farre, as that he had brought it to a Recantation or a publike diſgrace, could not have recompence of his credit by money, ſave onely in caſe of commutation: neither hee that had got his credit valued by money, could have a publique diſgrace

alſo inflicted for his ſatisfaction, but what way hee had choſen, with that he muſt have reſted contented, for that irefull mens wraths otherwiſe would never have beene ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and the proſecution of theſe actions otherwiſe would be confounded.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two kindes of proceedings the Princes and Sages of former ages ſeeme to have ſorted to the two kindes of Juriſdiction that are amongſt us, the one Spirituall, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Temporall: and therefore the Law of the Land it ſelfe ſaith, in a cauſe of Diffamation, when money is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but a thing done for puniſhment of ſinne, which is all one, as when the Civilians ſay, when it is done <hi>ad publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licam vindictam,</hi> it ſhall be tryed in the Spirituall Courts: whereupon by argument of contrary ſenſe it followeth, that where the puniſhment of ſinne is not required, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends in money is demanded, there it is to be tryed in the Temporall Court, for the Law would that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ery man ſhould have his remedie agreeable to reaſon in what ſort him beſt liketh. And therefore be the fault what it may be, that the words of the Diffamation do ſound unto, as long as it ſtands but in words, and the partie doth not take upon him to juſtifie the matter that is compriſed under thoſe words, and doth ſeeke but for the puniſhment of the ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous words onely, ſo long it is to be tried at the Spirituall Law; for the Law ſpeaketh in generall in caſes of Diffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, where puniſhment of ſinne onely is required: ſo that where a man is called Traitor, Felon, or murtherer, or any other crime belonging unto the Common-Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one of them words of great diffamation, ſo the partie therein ſeeke puniſhment onely, and not his private intereſt, there the Spirituall Law is to hold plea thereof. For where the Law doth not diſtinguiſh, there neither ought wee to diſtinguiſh: but the Law hath ſaid in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that cauſes of Diffamation, whoſe proſecution is thus qualified, do belong unto the tryall of the Spirituall Law: and therefore even thoſe caſes before remembred where the partie followeth this kinde of proſecutions, ought by
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16473:127"/>
that Law to belong unto the Spirituall Court, as on the contrarie ſide, Spirituall cauſes of Diffamation being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to a pecuniarie end ought to be ordered in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Court,</p>
                     <p>But where any man takes upon him to juſtifie the crime that hee hath objected, there either Court is to hold plea of the crime that properly belongeth to that Court, for that now words are no longer in queſtion, but matter is in try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, whether the partie diffamed hath indeed committed that offence that he is charged withall or no; which can be tryed in no other Court, than in that to which it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly appertaine. And that this was the courſe anciently held in matters of Diffamation betweene the Eccleſiaſticall and Common Law, it is manifeſt by the Statute of 2. of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Edw. 3. c. 11.</note> the 3. chapter 11. where although the Statute taxeth the perverſe dealing of ſuch, who when they had beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted before the Sherifes in their Returne, and after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by Inqueſt before the Juſtice of the Aſſiſe, did ſue the indictors in the Spirituall Court, ſurmiſing againſt them that they had diffamed them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that caſe forbad the like ſuits; for that juſtice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by was hindered, and many people were feared to indict Offenders: yet that Statute plainly ſheweth that in all other caſes of Diffamation riſing out of Temporall crimes beſide this, the Eccleſiaſticall Law had the cogniſance: and that this was forbidden, it was not for that words of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, could not be cenſured at the Eccleſiaſticall Law, when puniſhment of ſin onely is required, but for that it was not fit that thoſe things, which had beene once ordered in one Court, ſhould be called againe to examination in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and therefore the generall proceeding in matters of Diffamation, is not there prohibited, but the particular croſſing of matters after judgement is there reprehended.</p>
                     <p>So that the diſtinction whereof I formerly ſpake, which taketh upon it to determine when a caſe of Diffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is of the Temporall cogniſance, and when of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, cannot here take place: for that it is contrary to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:16473:128"/>
the former Statute or Decree that divided theſe caſes into Temporall or Eccleſiaſticall cogniſance by the varietie of the proſecution thereof, and that it is contrarie to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient practiſe that hath confirmed this proſecution in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Court, but eſpecially in the Eccleſiaſticall Court, which hath ſtill holden the triall of ſuch Diffamations wherein ſin hath bin only ſought to be puniſhed, untill now of late, that men have ſtept over the bankes, of theirautho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and confounded either Juriſdiction with the promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous acts one of another; when as the Statute it ſelfe is plaine, that the Authors of this Statute or Decree, whether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you call it, which ſet theſe bounds to either Law, in proceeding upon matters of Diffamation, reſpected not ſo much the qualitie of the crime, upon which the Diffamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grew, as the manner of proceeding therein, ayming in the one at publique vendict, which is to be ſought out of the Eccleſiaſticall Law, and in the other at private intereſt, which is to be had out of the Temporall Law.</p>
                     <p>Neither is an Action of Diffamation, a matter of ſo light eſteeme or qualitie, (a mans fame or good name being in equall ballance with his life) as that it ſhould be drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to be attendant on any other action that is of ſmaller weight or importance than it ſelfe is: for this is one of thoſe Actions which for the ſpeciall preheminence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are called <hi>Actiones praejudiciales,</hi> that is, ſuch that draw ſmaller cauſes unto them, but themſelves are drawne of none other, but ſuch as are like principall, or greater than themſelves are. So that unleſſe the manner of proceeding bring theſe cauſes under the compaſſe of the Common Law, in ſuch ſort as I have before ſhewed, the coupling of them with another matter of the ſame Law, will hardly bring them under the triall thereof: for that there be few actions greater then it ſelfe is, ſo that if the crime be Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, howſoever it toucheth a Temporall cauſe, the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſhall be ſtill at the Eccleſiaſticall Law. And the ſame that I ſay of Diffamations riſing out of Eccleſiaſticall crimes, I hold alſo to be true in Diffamations ſpringing out of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:16473:128"/>
Temporall crimes, where puniſhment is required for the offence committed, and amends in money is not demaund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſſe happily that grow of penance injoyned, which the offender will redeeme by giving money to the Judge, or to the partie grieved. And this I take to be a farre better limitation for either Law, having the ground of the Civile Law, and a Statute of the Common Law, and common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſelfe for it, than the other diviſe is, which ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth this buſineſſe, as ſtill it makes it reſt in the mouth of the Judge, which cauſe of Diffamation is meere ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and which not, which were not to be done if there were cleare dealing in the matter: for Lawes are ſo to be made, as that as little as may be, be left to the diſcretion of the Judge, but all be expreſſed as farre as the nature of the cauſe vvill give leave: vvhich albeit it be hard to doe, for the varietie of the caſes that every day happen, never thought on before, yet that is to be laboured ſo farre as may be; for this libertie of leaving many things to the Judges di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion, is many times great occaſion of confuſion in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, ſaying ſometimes this, and ſometimes that, as his private humor ſhall lead him: and therefore a plaine diſtinction betweene both the Lawes vvere beſt, that every man may ſee, and ſay vvhat is proper to either of them.</p>

Of ſingle women, ſome are ſuch as a man may make his wife, if himſelfe be ſole, and unmarried, as thoſe that are kept as Concubines in place of a mans wife; ſome other are ſuch as a man cannot make his wife, although himſelfe be ſole and unmarried, for that either they are already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contracted to ſome other, or that they be in ſo neere a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of affinitie or conſanguinitie one to the other, that the marriage would be damnable, &amp; the iſſue thereof unlawfull.</p>
                     <p>Of ſuch as are begotten of ſingle women, by ſingle men, who are in caſe to marrie them if they will, ſome are called by the Civile Law <hi>Filii Naturales,</hi> becauſe they were begot by ſuch as they held for their wives, and yet were not their wives, who might be legitimate by ſundry waies, as hereaſter ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>Some other begot of ſingle women, if they were begot in vage luſt, without any purpoſe to hold ſuch a one for a Concubine, but upon a deſire only to ſatisfie a mans preſent luſt, whether they were begotten by married men or ſingle men, were called <hi>Spurii,</hi> vvho for the moſt part are putative children, and their father is not otherwiſe knowne then by the mothers confeſſion, vvhich ſometimes ſaith true, ſometimes otherwiſe. <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſaith, they vvere ſo called becauſe they were borne out of puritie, for that ſuch kinde of luſt is contrary to holy Matrimonie, whoſe bed is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and therefore the other is corrupt, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
                     <p>But where any was borne of a woman ſingle or marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that proſtituted her ſelfe to every mans pleaſure, and made publike profeſſion of her ſelf to be an harlot, (ſuch as they are whom the Law calleth <hi>Scorta)</hi> theſe were called <hi>Manzeres.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe which were begotten of married women were called <hi>Nothi,</hi> becauſe they ſeemed to be his children whom the marriage doth ſhew, but are not, no otherwiſe than ſome feavers are called <hi>Nothi,</hi> that is, baſtard feavers, becauſe they imitate the tertian or quartan Feaver in heat, and other accidents, but yet are neither tertians nor quartans, as the

did by his laſt Will and Teſtament, or by ſome publick inſtrument ſubſcribed by witneſſe, name him to be his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and lawfull ſonne, or ſimply his ſonne, without the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any of theſe two words, baſe, or naturall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall did make him his heire, which could not be, but in ſuch caſes onely, where the father had no other naturall and lawfull childe left alive.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, whereas the Prince by his Reſcript, or the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate by their Decree, did doe any one that credit, as to grant them the favour of legitimation, which was done, for the moſt part, in ſuch caſes onely, where either the father of the childe, or the childe himſelfe, offered himſelfe to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant on the Court or Prince.</p>
                     <p>In this Realme, none of the foreſaid legitimations take place, as farre as I can learne, but onely that which is done by Parliament, and that very rarely; for beſides thoſe that King <hi>Henry</hi> the eigth did in the variety and mutability of <note place="margin">28. 8. cap. 7.</note> his minde, towards his owne iſſue, I thinke there cannot be many examples ſhewed: for, as for that which is wrought <note place="margin">1. Mar. 1. parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament. cap. 1</note> by ſubſequent Marriage, being a thing anciently preſſed by the Clergie of this Land, to be admitted in like ſort, as it is uſed in other Lands, where the Eccleſiaſticall Law taketh place; it was rejected by the Earles and Barons with one voyce, and anſwer was made, that they would not change the Lawes of the Realme in that point, which to that time had beene uſed and approved. All theſe caſes of Baſtardie in other Lands, whether they be ſuch, or not ſuch, are tria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the Eccleſiaſticall Law: But here with us it is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, to what Law, and how farre they doe appertaine, whether to the Eccleſiaſticall or Temporall.</p>
                     <p>For the matter of Baſtardie, what it is, the Eccleſiaſticall Law, and the Temporall differ not; but there is a diverſitie betweene them in the proſecution thereof, for the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Law bringeth it two wayes in Judgement; the one incidently, the other principally; but the Common Law ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth two ſorts thereof, the one generall, the other ſpeciall: But firſt of the Eccleſiaſticall diviſion, then of the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:16473:130"/>
Baſtardie is then ſaid to be incidently propounded, when it is laid in barre of ſome other thing, that is principally commenced; as when one ſueth for an inheritance that he pretendeth is due unto him by his nativitie, an other croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him therein, by objecting againſt him baſtardie, with purpoſe to exclude him from his action in the inheritance: here the barre is in the incident, becauſe it comes excluſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the action of inheritance, but the action for the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it ſelfe was in the principall, for that it was begun in conſideration of the inheritance, and not with intent to prove himſelfe legitimate; which happily hee never dreamed of, when he firſt entered his action for the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. In which caſe, he which is charged with the baſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, may require himſelfe to be admitted to prove himſelfe legitimate, before the Eccleſiaſticall Judge, and to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to be ſuch a one. <hi>Ad Curiam enim Regiamnon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet</hi>

                     <p>But Baſtardie is then taken to bee principally propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when either one finding himſelfe to be greeved with ſome malicious ſpeech of his adverſarie, reproaching him with Baſtardie, or himſelfe fearing to be impeached in his good name, or right, doth take a courſe to cleere his nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by calling into the Law, him or them by whom hee is reproached, or feareth to bee impeached in his right and

credit, to ſee him, to prove himſelfe legitimate, and to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; object againſt it, if they ought have, or can have to the contrary: which if either they doe not, or doing to the utmoſt what they can, can bring no good matter againſt his proofe, but that it ſtands ſtill good and effectuall in Law, to all intents and purpoſes whatſoever (although perhaps hereby hee ſhall not be able to carry the inheritance, both for that it appertaineth not to the Eccleſiaſticall Law, to judge of Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments; and alſo for that there is a preciſe forme ſet downe by Statute, how ſuits of this nature ſhall be recovered) yet if no oppoſite or contradicter appeare herein, and the ſuit was onely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand againſt ſuch, as either openly reproached him, or ſecretly buzzed abroad ſlanderous ſpeeches, as concerning his legitimation: it is not to be doubted, but by an accident alſo it will be good for the inheritance it ſelfe, for where a mans legitimation is ſufficiently proved, thereon followeth all things which naturally thereto belong. But if any man <note place="margin">9. Hen. 6. c. 11.</note> urge the forme of the Statute, being intereſſed therein, then muſt it neceſſarily be followed, for that otherwiſe it would be thought, all that was done before, ſo farre as it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the inheritance, although it were but in a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, were done by colluſion. This kinde of proceeding hath been much more in uſe in former times than it is now, and never any oppoſition made againſt it: but now it goeth not altogether cleere without contradiction, as many other things are offenſively taken, which notwithſtanding have good ground, and ſufficient warrant for them.</p>
                     <p>And ſo farre as concerning the Eccleſiaſticall proceedings in this buſineſſe: Now to the Temporall ſorts of them.</p>
                     <p>Generall Baſtardie is ſo called, becauſe it comes in inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and is in groſſe objected againſt ſome that ſue in a matter principall, to diſappoint his ſuit. This ſuit, becauſe it is of the Eccleſiaſticall cogniſance, it is ſent by the Kings writ to the Ordinarie, with certaine additions for more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity of the inquirie thereof; as that whether he that is charged with the Baſtardie, were borne in lawfull Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,

All which the Ordinarie makes inquirie upon by his owne Ordinarie and paſtorall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; for that matters of Baſtardy doe originally belong to the Eccleſiaſticall Court, and not to the Temporall: And as hee findes the trueth of the matter by due examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bee this, or that, ſo hee pronounceth for the ſame in his owne Conſiſtorie, and makes certificate thereupon to the Kings Court accordingly; and as hee pronounceth, ſo the Temporall Judges follow his ſentence in their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, either for, or againſt the Inheritance that is in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
                     <p>Speciall Baſtardy they ſay is that, where the Matrimony <note place="margin">Bracton.</note> is confeſſed, but the priority or poſterioritie of the Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of him whoſe birth is in queſtion, is controverſed; which to my thinking, if I conceive aright, is no other thing than the generall baſtardie, tranſported in words, but agreeing in ſubſtance &amp; matter with the other: for even theſe things which they pretend make ſpeciall Baſtardie, are parts and members of the generall Baſtardie, and are either confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or inquired upon by vertue of the Kings writ in the ſame: For firſt for the Matrimonie that is here mentioned, it is there agniſed both by the Plaintife in pleading of it, and the Defendant in the anſwering thereto, and therefore the Plaintifes plea is thus; Thou art a Baſtard, for that thou waſt borne before thy parents were lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted together in Marriage, or before their Marriage was ſolemnized in the face of the Church: To which the Defendants reply is, I am no Baſtard, for that I was borne in lawfull Matrimony, or that I was borne after that my Father and Mother were lawfully married together: In both which you ſee, there is a Marriage confeſſed, and the queſtion onely is of the priority or poſteriority of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of him that is charged withall, whether it happened before, or after his parents marriage, which, as they hold, is the other member of ſpeciall Baſtardie: and yet this
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:16473:132"/>
prioritie or poſterioritie of nativity, by vertue of the Kings writ, comes no leſſe in inquirie to the Ordinarie in the caſe of the generall Baſtardie, than they make it to be traverſable in the ſpeciall Baſtardie; and therefore the writ to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary for generall Baſtardie, is conceived in this manner: <hi>viz. Inqutratis utrum praedictus A. pars rea, genitus vel na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Lib. Intrac. fol. 35.</note>

But to ſay the truth, if theſe things be well weighed and conſidered, ſpeciall Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardie is nothing elſe, but the definition of the generall, and the generall againe is nothing but the definite of the ſpeciall: for whoſoever is born out of, or before lawfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, hee is a Baſtard, and he againe is a Baſtard that is borne before, or out of lawfull Matrimony, ſo that theſe things to bee a Baſtard, and to bee borne out of lawfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony are convertible one with the other: ſo then as it were very hard to make a divorce betweene theſe things that are ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

H.</hi> that then they ſhould intimate the ſame to the ſecular Judge, before whom the inheritance was in queſtion, that he ſhould not ſtay any longer upon the queſtion of legitimation, but proceed to Judgement in the cauſe of the inheritance. Which preſident, though it be long before the Statute of Baſtardie, made by <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. and ſo no writ went from the Temporall Court, for the certificate thereof: yet it ſhewes, that the Temporall Judges in thoſe dayes did not proceed to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the principall cauſe, before the incident were deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Ordinarie; and that they counted baſtardy then to be of the Eccleſiaſticall cogniſance; and that it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him that was pretended to be a Baſtard, to appeale from his Ordinarie, if either the Ordinarie detracted the determination thereof, or were ſuſpected of partiality.</p>
                     <p>And thus farre of the incident.

But the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> after under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by the ſaid Delegates, that the plea of inheritance within this Realme, did not belong unto the Church, but unto the King, recall'd that part of his reſcript, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the reſtitution of the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> to his inheritance, and gave order to the foreſaid Biſhops, to proceed in the cauſe of legitimation; willing them to inquire, whether the ſaid <hi>Agatha</hi> were borne of the ſaid <hi>Aneline</hi> in the life time of her huſband <hi>Allin,</hi> &amp; when ſhe dwelt and cohabited with him, as with her huſband; or whether the ſaid <hi>Ralphe,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſaid <hi>Agatha,</hi> kept the ſaid <hi>Aneline</hi> openly and publickly, while the ſaid <hi>Allin</hi> yet lived; And if they found it to be ſo, then they ſhould pronounce her the ſaid <hi>Agatha</hi> to bee a Baſtard, for that <hi>Anelina</hi> her Mother could not bee counted to bee a wife, but a whore, which defiling her huſbands bed, preſumed to keepe company with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, her huſband yet being alive: But if they found it otherwiſe, then they ſhould pronounce her, the ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatha</hi>

All which was done after the death of the ſaid <hi>Ralph</hi> and <hi>Aneline,</hi> as the Decretall it ſelfe ſhewes: Neither was there any authoritie that oppoſed it ſelfe againſt that proceeding, but held it to be good and lawfull, though it were in terme of ſpeciall Baſtardie, for then that which they now call ſpeciall Baſtardie, was not borne. Beſides hereby it appeareth, that the Ordinaries then did not onely proceed in caſes of Baſtardie incidently, that is, when a ſuit was before begun in the Common Law, upon a triall of inheritance, and that by writ from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Courts, but even originally, and that to prepare way unto inheritance, or any other good that was like to accrue unto a man by ſucceſſion, or to avoid any inconvenience that might keepe him from promotion, as may appeare by this practiſe following.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is not to be doubted, but it was the full minde and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Lawmakers, which made thoſe three Statutes to infeoffe the Eccleſiaſticall Courts in the inheritance of all thoſe cauſes that are compriſed in thoſe Statutes, ſave thoſe that are by ſpeciall name exempted, and that they did by the ſaid Statute, as it were deliver unto them full and quiet poſſeſſion of the ſame, for even ſo ſundrie branches of the ſaid Statute do ſhew, as I have elſewhere made it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: and that there hath growne queſtion upon many points thereof, and that the profeſſours of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Law have beene interupted in the quiet poſſeſſion thereof, commeth of the unperfect penning of the ſame, and not of any juſt title or claime that may be made by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of the other Law thereunto: but this is a thing
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:16473:136"/>
not onely proper to theſe three Statutes, but alſo common to all other Statutes which are writ of any Eccleſiaſticall cauſes within this Land; which notwithſtanding may be remedied, if it ſeeme good unto his ſacred Majeſtie and the reſt of the wiſedome of the land aſſembled together at any time for the making of wholſome Lawes, and the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the ſame, by ſupply of a few words in ſome places, or periods that are defective, and yet keeping the true meaning and ſenſe of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>As for example in the Statute of the two and thirtieth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, in the § wherefore, neere the beginning of the ſame Statute, the Statute ordering, that all perſons of this Realme, and other of the Kings Dominions ſhall truly, and effectually ſet out, and pay all and ſingular Tythes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lawfull cuſtomes, and uſages of the Pariſhes where they grow, and become due: becauſe there is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion made where theſe cuſtomes and uſages ſhall be tryed, in the Eccleſiaſticall or Temporall Law; if theſe or the like words had beene added to the ſame (to be proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Eccleſiaſticall Judge after the forme of the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Law, and not elſewhere) the whole matter had beene cleare for that point.</p>
                     <p>And whereas againe in the end of the ſame Statute, there be ſome good words tending to the appropriating of theſe matters of Tythes, and obligations, and other Eccleſiaſticall duties to the Eccleſiaſticall Court: and that the remedie for them ſhall be had in the Spirituall Court according to the ordinance of the firſt part of that Act, and not otherwiſe: yet becauſe there is no penaltie to that act, buſie men eaſilie make a breach thereinto, for that Lawes without penalties, for the moſt part are weake &amp; of no force: if therefore this or the like ſupply were made (if any man ſue for theſe, or like duties in any other Court, than in the Kings Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call court, the parties ſo ſuing, to forfeit the treble value of that which he ſued for, to be recovered in the Kings Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Court, where it ought to have bin commenced, by the way of Libells, or Articles, the one halfe thereof ſhall
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:16473:137"/>
be to the King, the other to the partie grieved) many of theſe ſuits would eaſily be met withall. Neither is it to the purpoſe that this is matter of mony, and Lay-Fee that ſhould be in this ſort forfeited, and therefore is not Regularly to be ſued for in the Eccleſiaſticall Court; for ſeeing the cauſe is Eccleſiaſticall, upon which the matter of forfeiture ariſeth, it may be very well allowed, <hi>Ne continentiae cauſarum divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantur:</hi> and for that ordinarily every juriſdiction that is wronged may defend it ſelfe with a penaltie: beſide, we do by the like right in the Eccleſiaſticall courts recover expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſuits in Law, fees of Advocates, &amp; Proctors, &amp; mony for redemption of ſin, ſo that it will be no ſtrange matter to have this kinde of ſuit allowed unto the Eccleſiaſticall Court.</p>
                     <p>Further, whereas there are in the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, chapter 13. in the beginning almoſt of the ſaid Statute two clauſes under paine of forfeiture, one of treble value, for Tythes carried away before they were divided, ſet out, or agreed for: The other of double value where the Tythes were hurt or impared by the partie ſtopping or letting him that had intereſt thereunto to carrie them away, or by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, or carrying them away himſelfe; &amp; the ſame is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by a clauſe in the ſecond branch thereof reaching unto them both (for that a clauſe put in the end of two ſentences, ſtretcheth it ſelfe indifferently unto them both, if there be no more reaſon it ſhould belong to the one than the other, as there is not in this caſe, for if it were not ſo, the firſt penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had no order ſet down, how it might be recovered) that the ſame ſhall be recovered according to the Kings Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Law: to which if there were added this word [only] and not elſewhere, or otherwiſe, and they martialled in their right places, there were nothing more ſure or ſtrong.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, whereas in the firſt proviſo of that Statute it is decreed, that none ſhall be compelled to pay any manner of Tythes for any Hereditaments, which by the Lawes or Statutes of the Realme, or by any Priviledge, Preſcription, or Compoſition Reall, are not chargeable therewithall; whereby it is doubtfull in what Court the ſaid Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:16473:137"/>
are to be alledged: if there were inſerted theſe words, or other of like nature [the ſaid Lawes, Statutes, Priviledges, Preſcriptions, or Compoſitions reall to be alledged, argued, traverſed, and determined before the Eccleſiaſticall Judge onely according to the forme of the Eccleſiaſticall Lawes, and not elſe-where] upon like forfeiture of treble damma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as is aforeſaid, it would make this poynt ſure unto the Eccleſiaſticall Law.</p>
                     <p>Over and beſides this, whereas in the ſame Statute there is a diſcharge allowed to barren, heath, and waſte ground, in ſome for not payment of tythes, in other for the manner of payment of them for the ſpace of 7. yeares, after the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and converting of them into arrable ground or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; it would make the matter plaine, which Law ſhould have the pronouncing thereupon, if there were added theſe or the like words [So the ſame ground be proved in forme of Law in the Eccleſiaſticall Court, to be barren, heath, and waſte.]</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, whereas in the ſaid Statute among other limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of cauſes, wherein the Eccleſiaſticall Judge is not to deale by vertue of the ſaid Statute, there is one in theſe words, neere the end of the ſaid Statute [Ne in any matter whereof the Kings Court of right ought to have Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on] which limitation is ſo vage &amp; large, that thereout there may be forged as many divers kindes of Prohibitions, as the Poets ſained <hi>Vulcan</hi> ever made thunderbolts for <hi>Jupiter.</hi> And therefore it were very well and conſonant to the good meaning of the ſaid Statute, that this vageneſſe were reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and reduced to a more certainty of matter, by theſe or like words, [By any ancient Law or Statute of this Land.]</p>

Therefore let the houſe, &amp; all other his moveable goods ſtill remaine in the Patrimonie of the childe, neither let any edifices or buildings, which came in good reparation with the inheritance, ruine or decay by colluſion of the Tutor: but rather if the Father, or hee whoſoever the minor was heire unto, left any building in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, let the Tutor both by the Teſtimony of the worke it ſelfe, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I finde an old practice auciently uſed in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Courts, for reſtraining Executors or Adminiſtrators for dealing covenouſly in an Executorſhip or Adminiſtrator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, when there are more Executors named in a Will, than one, or more Adminiſtrators deputed by the Ordinary in an Adminiſtration than one, which were well if it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, and brought backe to his former uſe againe. For now, as things ſtand many times one capricious fellow na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an Executor in a Will, or appointed Adminiſtrator by the Ordinary with ſome other well-meaning men, getting a ſtart in this buſineſſe of the reſt, ingroſſeth all into his owne hands, and without privitie, or concurrence of the other, ſelleth, releaſeth, and diſpoſeth all at his owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, contrary to the minde either of the Teſtator, or the Ordinary, who would not have named ſo many in the Will, or Adminiſtration, but to the intent that all might or ſhould execute and adminiſter, and one communicate their acts with another. The contrarie whereof is many times very prejudiciall and hurtfull, to thoſe that are to take benefit by the ſaid Will or Adminiſtration, who for the vvant of the due performance of this kinde of proceeding, are defrauded of all that which in right or reaſon ſhould have come unto them, either by the Teſtators good-will, or by the benefit of the Law. And yet there is no remedie for this in Law, ſo farre as I know, for that all theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king but one perſon in Law, the Law yeelds no action to the one to ſue the other: but yet the ancient practiſe of the Eccleſiaſticall Law hath remedie, which would redreſſe all this miſchiefe, if it were called again to uſe, &amp; might goe without controlme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as the equity of the cauſe doth require. And the remedie is this, that ſuch other of the Executors
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:16473:142"/>
or Adminiſtrators as are in this ſort interverted from the execution of the Will, or Adminiſtration by the ſubtiltie of any like Executor or Adminiſtrator, ſhould crave the aſſiſtance of the Judge, and will him by vertue of his office, to call in ſuch practique Executor or Adminiſtrator, and to command him under paine of excommunication, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further in the ſole execution thereof, but commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate all his acts, and dealings with the reſt of his Coexe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors or Coadminiſtrators: which if it were ſo ordered, would make many mens Wills and Adminiſtrations bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter performed than they are, and a great ſort of poore Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans ſtates more ſure and certaine, than commonly they are in ſuch Executors or Adminiſtrators hands.</p>
                     <p>And certainly in this caſe, there is ſome good uſe of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſors in dead mens Wils (whom many men meerly jeſtar, calling them candle-holders, as though they could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in the execution therof, but hold the candle while the Executors tell the Defuncts mony) if they might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to put in practiſe that authoritie which the Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them, and that is when they finde any Executor deale fraudulently in the execution of any Teſtators Will, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are named ſuperviſors, or do ingroſſe all the ſtate of the Defunct into his hands, as hath beene before ſaid, they call him to a particular account, that it may be ſeene how the adminiſtration ſtands, and each Executor may commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to other particular receipts and disburſements: which if any ſhall refuſe to do, then may the Superviſor make thereof complaint unto the Judge, as though the ſame man dealt not truly in the execution thereof, who though perhaps in the beginning could not take bond of him, for <note place="margin">ff De admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratione tuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. l. 3. §. 1.</note> the true execution of the Will (becauſe the Teſtator had made choice of him, and therein approved his faith, and that no man required caution of him for any Legacie in the Will be queathed, in which caſe the Judge might take bond of him for ſecuritie of ſuch Lagacies as are bequeathed in the Will, yea though his faith hath beene approved by the Ordinarie, as hath beene before remembred) yet may the

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:16473:143"/>
parts of my diviſion, I will in a word or two make plaine the neceſſitie thereof.</p>
                  <p>And therefore for a ground of all the reſt, I will aſſume this for a matter confeſſed, that every man knowes, that every well ordered Common-wealth ſtands on two parts principally, the politick part, which conſiſteth of the Prince and people, and the Eccleſiaſticall part which ſtandeth in <hi>Sacris &amp; Sacerdotibus.</hi> And therefore well ſaid the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, Two of the greateſt things that God ever gave unto <note place="margin">In authent. quon. oport. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopod in prin. col. 1. Auth. de non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienand. &amp;c. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but Eccl. c. 2. §. 1.</note> the world (meaning earthly things) was the Empire or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular government whereby the outward man is ordered and made, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>bonus civis,</hi> that is, a good and loyall ſubject: and the Prieſthood whereby the inward man is ruled, and is made, as the ſaid Author teſtifieth, <hi>bonus vir,</hi> that is, a good and vertuous man, which are two won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull effects of the whole government in generall; neither can the one of theſe be wanting, but the other will be ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and brought to deſolation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, no man is ignorant of this, but in politique government two things ſway the whole ſtate, the one is peace at home, and the other is warre abroad: which as they have their ſeaſons, ſo they have their cauſes and effects, the one from counſell at home, the other from diſcipline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; neither can the one, or the other of theſe be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but by their private and proper Lawes.</p>
                  <p>Beſide, in peace who ſeeth not, there is as much need of vent by ſea, for to benefit the Common-wealth by, either by importation of thoſe things that wee want at home, or by exportation of thoſe things wee abound with; as there is proviſion to be made for the increaſing and preſerving of thoſe things that wee have riſing and growing by land in our owne countrie, neither of which can be had or injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without their proper Lawes fit and appertaining to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther policie? And what Law is there that ordereth theſe buſineſſes but the Civile Law onely, which giveth a forme to Navigation, and all occurrents that happen by ſea, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be in, or about the Navigation it ſelfe or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contracts,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:16473:143"/>
or as it were contracts that are made in, upon, or beyond the ſame.</p>
                  <p>As a Legall forme is requiſite in peace at home, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine affaires abroad, that every thing may have his due ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect according to the right thereof, ſo alſo it is neceſſary in warlike exploits upon the Sea, that every action have his limits and bounds, whereby Juſtice may bee miniſtred: which if it be to be obſerved where lawfull warre is held betweene Prince and Prince, that every one be not left unto his owne luſt, much more is it expedient to be put in ure in Piracies and other Sea-robberies, where the innocent is ſpoyled, and the ſpoiler is enriched. The redreſſe whereof is not, but by the Admirall Law, to whom the Princes of this Land have granted that authoritie.</p>
                  <p>For the often commerce of Princes with Princes, &amp; the negotiation that one State hath with an other, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more neceſſary, than frequent Embaſſages, wereby intelligence may be had what danger one State intendeth to an other, &amp; how the ſame may be prevented by Leagues or otherwiſe, and how the ſame may be made and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: I know not what Law ſerves better for all theſe ends and purpoſes than the Civile Law.</p>
                  <p>In matters that appertaine to the ſoules health, the Preacher teacheth out of the word of God, wherein the right ſervice of God ſtandeth, hee miniſtreth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto the people, and inſtructeth them in other fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall points of Religion. but it is the Eccleſiaſticall Law that compelleth men to the due obſervance hereof, and puniſheth the trangreſſors.</p>
                  <p>All men grant, that there is a proviſion to be made for the Miniſter, for that it is againſt reaſon that any man ſhould goe to warfare on his charges: but it is the Law of the Church that ſets out this proviſion, and yeeldeth remedie for the recoverie thereof, if it be denied.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is more due unto the dead, than that their laſt Wils ſhould be obſerved; for that it is ſuch an ordinance as a man hath not in his power againe, when God hath once called him hence, neither is there any thing that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:16473:144"/>
have more gratiouſly granted unto their ſubjects, than that in their life-time they may diſpoſe of that which after they are dead, is none of theirs; and yet ſhall take place when they are not, as though yet they were theirs: in which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion the Civile and the Eccleſiaſticall Law, are above all other Lawes moſt religious.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtening, Wedding, Burying, whereby a man entreth into this world, converſeth in the world, and returneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine unto the earth, from whence he was taken, and ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſeth to glorie, and everlaſting bliſſe, are every one of the Eccleſiaſticall cogniſance.</p>
                  <p>How many men of great skill, ſuch as few Princes have greater in all kinde of learning, are of this ranke, not only in the ſocietie of them that profeſſe this knowledge here in the chiefeſt Citie of the Land, but alſo in both the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and in ſundry other places of this Realme, not ſtrangers, or forrainers, but home-borne ſubjects, of the ſame faith, of the ſame religion, of the ſame kindred, and familie, of like alleagiance to the Prince, and ſervice to the Commonwealth as other his good ſubjects are, even thoſe that oppugne this profeſſion chiefly; whoſe practice, if it be overthrowne, or proviſion leſſened, not onely thoſe that are now preſent, &amp; make profeſſion of this knowledge ſhall be faine to turne their copie, but thoſe that are futurely to come, will change their profeſſion, when they ſee there is no reward or eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation belonging thereto? for it is honour that nouriſheth Arts, and no man will follow that profeſſion that is out of count, and credit; but every Father will ſay unto his Son in like ſort as <hi>Ovids</hi> Father ſaid to him, when hee ſaw him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and give himſelfe wholy to Poetrie, <hi>Studium quid inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile tent as?</hi> It was anciently ſaid of the profeſſion of theſe Lawes, <hi>Dat Juſtinianus honores;</hi> but now it is ſo far off from that, that it conferres honours, as that it is almoſt a diſcre. dit for any man to be a Civilian in this State, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion thereof doth ſcarce keepe beggerie from the gate.</p>
                  <p>As God doth diſpoſe his government by juſtice &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie (whoreof notwithſtanding mercie hath the ſupreme place in the Lords Tabernacle, as that which was put above
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:16473:144"/>
upon the Arke, wherein were the two Tables of ſtone, in which the Law was written, to which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>James</hi> alluding, <note place="margin">Exod 25.</note> ſaith, that mercie triumpheth over judgement) ſo the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Land to the imitation of that heavenly repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <note place="margin">lames. 2.</note> have appointed two ſupreme ſeats of Government within this Land, the one of juſtice, wherein nothing but the ſtrict letter of the Law is obſerved, the other of Mercie, wherein the rigour of the Law is tempered with the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of equitie, which is nothing elſe but mercie qualifying the ſharpeneſſe of Juſtice: to either which Courts they have ſorted men fit for their skill, and education to manage the ſame; that is, to the ſeat of Juſtice, the profeſſors of the Law of this Land, who may be thought beſt to know the Juſtice of the ſame: but to the other they have aſſigned the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Civill Law, for that a great ſort of titles of that Law, are titles of equitie, as, whatſoever is <hi>Jus praetorium,</hi> or <hi>Jus aedilicium,</hi> with them is matter of equitie; ſo that they may ſeeme beſt able for their skill in theſe titles (of which no other Land hath the like) to aſſiſt the Lord Chancellour in matters of Conſcience. Who though he be a man, for the moſt part, choſen by the Prince himſelfe, out of the reſt of the Sages of this Land, for his ſpeciall good parts of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and integritie above the reſt (as now the honourable perſon is that occupieth that place, who is, as <hi>Tullie</hi> ſaid of that eloquent Orator <hi>Marcus Craſſus, Non unus ex multis, ſed unus inter omnes propè ſingularis)</hi> ſo that they might be thought for their great and eminent wiſdome in all things appertaining to their place, able to direct themſelves; yet becauſe it is, <hi>Divinitatis potiùs qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> humanitatis, omniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> habere memoriam, &amp; in nullo errare,</hi> as one ſaith, It was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently done by Princes of former age, to joyne to theſe great perſonages, men furniſhed with knowledge in theſe caſes of conſcience; wherin if they ſhould at any time ſtick, they might be adviſed by them that are aſſeſſors with them, what they find in the law proportionable to the caſe in hand, that thereto they might ſquare their decree, or order accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; whoſe variety in theſe caſes is ſuch, that hardly there can fall out any caſe in practice, but there will be ſome Law,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:16473:145"/>
in that learning, conformable unto it: which opportunity of men furniſhed with this knowledge for that ſeat, his Majeſty ſhall want, unleſſe the ſtudy of the Civill &amp; Eccleſiaſticall Law be maintain'd, which alſo for the caſes of equity &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtience therin, is cald of the old writers, <hi>Aequitas Canonica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what reaſon gave occaſion to theſe precedent Princes to place men indowed with the skill of the Civill Law, in the Court of Chancerie, the ſame alſo miniſtred unto them mindes to commit unto the ſelfe ſame men, the ordering of their Courts of Requeſts: for that therein, for the moſt part are handled poore miſerable perſons cauſes, as widows and Orphans, and other diſtreſſed people, whoſe caſes wholy relie on pietie and conſcience, as a fit ſubject for that Law to deale in, which alſo will take a maime, if the ſtudie of the Civill Law be not upholden.</p>
                  <p>So then to deny a free courſe to the Civill and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Law in this Land, in ſuch things as appertaine to their profeſſion, or to abbridge the maintenance thereof, is to ſpoyle his Majeſtie of a part of his honour (whoſe glory it is to be furniſhed with all ſorts of profeſſions neceſſary for his ſtate, and beneficiall for his ſubject) to weaken the State publique, &amp; bereave it of grave and ſage men, to adviſe the State in matters of doubt and controverſie betweene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Nations and themſelves, to diſarme the Church of her faithfull friends &amp; followers, and ſo to cut the ſinewes (as much as in them lyeth) of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, and to expoſe her to the teeth of thoſe, who for theſe many yeares have ſought to devoure her up; and ſo now would do it, if the mercifull providence of God, and the gracious eye of the Prince did not watch over her.</p>
                  <p>And ſo far of the neceſſitie of theſe two profeſſions, and generally of the uſe and diſuſe of the Civill and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Law in this Land, and wherein it is overlaid by the Common-Law, and how it may be relieved, if it ſeeme good unto his Majeſtie, and the wiſedome of this Realme. All which I have written, not of any purpoſe to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the credit of that Law, under which I was borne, and by which I hold that ſmall maintenance that I have: (fo,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:16473:145"/>
I reverence it as a neceſſary Law for this State, and make ſuch reckoning of every of the profeſſours in his place, as becommeth me) but that it pitieth mee, and not only mee, but all thoſe that tender good learning, and have no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate minde toward the Common-Law, to ſee two ſuch Noble Sciences as the Civill and Eccleſiaſticall Law are, ſo to be diſgraced, as that there is no more reckoning made of them, or their profeſſours, than if they were matters and men of no worth, and fit or apt for no ſervice in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: and yet notwithſtanding, the uſe of them is ſo neceſſarie as that the Common-wealth cannot want the ſervice of them in matter of great importance to the State, which (if the profeſſion ſhould come to a downefall, as it is like ſhortly to do, if it be no more cheriſhed and made of than it is) will be ſooner ſeene by the want of them, than is now perceived by the having of them; and then perhaps, will the State lament for the loſſe of ſo goodly a profeſſion, when it will be hardly recovered againe, as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did for the tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> when they had in one dey ſlaine well nigh the whole number of them.</p>
